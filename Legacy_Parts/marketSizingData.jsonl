{"prompt": "Bling Capital Blog\nA collection of product and company building guides for our founders and community\n\nHome Bling Capital Website Archives\nHow to Size a Market in 30 minutes\nFebruary 13, 2023\nVenture investors will often ask a founder the potential size of their startup. A core part of answering this question has to do with market size, commonly known as total addressable market (or “TAM”).\n\nThe post below will outline\n\nwhy venture investors care about TAM\ncommon mistakes founders make when sizing their market(s) including examples, and\nthe Bling Capital approach\nWhy is this important?\nOur goal with market sizing is to understand how big your startup can get if things go well.\n\nVenture Capital investors often ask themselves: Is this startup’s market sufficiently large to support a “venture scale” return?\n\nTo be considered “venture scale”, a lead investor’s equity in a startup (say 10% at the seed stage) has to have the potential to return their fund. Therefore, if a seed fund is $100M, an investor generally wants to see a path for any portfolio companies to become a $1B enterprise value company if things go well.\n\nWhat happens if you’re seeking to raise venture capital, yet a venture investor believes your TAM is too small?\n\nIf an investor believes this during your fundraising process (rightly or wrongly), they may pass with the reason being “not enough conviction on the market”.\nIf discovered after investing that the market is indeed too small, they may influence founders to strategically focus on a venture scale outcome which will naturally be more challenging in a smaller market.\nAs a startup founder, putting together a clear and concise “back-of-envelope” market sizing that articulates a path to $100M and $500M, respectively, in gross profit will not only help avoid scenarios above but will also be helpful to driving business strategy and go to market approach. We use $100M and $500M as benchmarks for a “venture scale” business and “venture home run” business, respectively. The reason we favor gross profit over revenue for this exercise is because different markets and business models have varying gross margins, and gross profit better accounts for these differences.\n\nCommon Mistakes\nMany market-sizing approaches result in numbers that may not resemble the reality of a startup’s current or even future potential market size. Below are four common mistakes we often see founders make when talking about market sizing, and we’ll outline each with relevant examples using two of our portfolio companies: Lyft (Marketplace) and Lucidchart (SaaS). These examples build on each other.\n\nLyft is one of the leading ride share companies in the U.S. and is often evaluated as a marketplace.\nLucidchart is a growth stage SaaS company for diagramming, data visualization and collaboration.\nMISTAKE 1: FOCUSING ON TOP-DOWN TOTAL MARKET SIZE ALONE\nWhy it doesn’t work: Too generic, often doesn’t display a deep understanding of the market for this specific product\n\nExample 1a: Lyft\tExample 1b: LucidChart’s market\n“Lyft’s market size (“TAM”) is equal to the total spend on taxis and limos in the United States.”\t“The total spend on cloud tools is $X billion and Microsoft Vizio’s revenues are $Y millions, so our TAM is $x+$y.”\nBetter Approach: A bottoms-up approach that includes (1) the existing market (2) how Lyft’s approach (convenience, price, customer experience) would expand the current market (3) broader market trends (in this case, gig economy, proliferation of mobile devices) that would expand the current market.\tBetter Approach: A bottoms up approach that includes (1) your insight into the broader market trend (in this case, the # of SMEs in 2010 will 100x over the next 10 years), (2) your buyer persona, and (3) how Lucidchart is dramatically improving a free product with a product users are willing to pay for (SaaS model).\nMISTAKE 2: NOT SEGMENTING YOUR BOTTOMS-UP MARKET SIZING ANALYSIS\nWhy it doesn’t work: Omits go to market (GTM) strategy\n\nExample 2a: Lyft\tExample 2b: LucidChart’s market\n“There are XX millions of people who can use Lyft. If they spend $Y on rides per year, then our TAM is $XY millions”.\t“There are XX millions of people who could use LucidChart. If they pay us $Y per year, then our total addressable market is $XY millions.”\nBetter Approach: Segment your markets by city size and key characteristics:\nTier 1 = large + urban like LA\nTier 2 = mid-size+suburban like Dallas\nTier 3 = smaller + more rural like Tulsa\nThen show how many cities exist per segment and provide reasonable assumptions for average total GMV per tier. [1]\tBetter Approach: Segment your customers based on buyer persona. If the buyer is a company, you should segment the customer by company size:\nEnterprise: 10K+ employees like Google\nMidmarket: 1k-10k employees like Datadog\nSME: <100 employees such as a startup\nThen show how many companies exist per segment and provide reasonable assumptions for average ACV (annual contract value) per segment. [2]\nMISTAKE 3: STATIC GROWTH AND UNREALISTIC PENETRATION NUMBERS\nWhy it doesn’t work: Doesn’t illustrate your path toward more revenue ($10M, $100M, $500M) with reasonable market penetration (e.g., 1% vs 50%)\n\nExample 3a: Lyft\tExample 3b: LucidChart’s market\n“The TAM for Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 segments is $y. At 75% market penetration we will generate $xB in revenue.”\t“The TAM for Enterprise+, Enterprise, and SME segments is $y. At 75% market penetration we will generate $xB in revenue.”\nBetter Approach: Articulate your launch city and reasonable penetration for that launch city. Use that “launch playbook” to articulate expansion to X additional cities that look like your launch city until you reach $100M and then $500M in revenue with reasonable penetration rates (e.g., 5% per city). The idea is to “tell the story” of how your market and business model will unfold over time. [3]\tBetter Approach: Articulate your ideal buyer and in which segments those buyers exist. Then, articulate reasonable penetration assumptions for those segments, and how you will expand over time until you reach $100M and $500M in revenue. The idea is to “tell the story” of how your market and business model will unfold over time (e.g., # SMEs 10x in 10 years). [4] [5]\nMISTAKE 4: USING TOP-LINE REVENUE OR GMV INSTEAD OF GROSS PROFIT\nWhy it doesn’t work: Top-line revenue or GMV leaves out the cost of delivering revenue and over inflates market size\n\nExample 4a: Lyft\tExample 4b: LucidChart’s market\nWe need x Tier 1 cities with 2% market penetration each to hit $100M in GMV, and x Tier 1 cities and x Tier 2 cities with 1% market penetration to hit $500M in GMV.\tWe need x enterprise customers, and x SME customers paying us $y ACV, including one-time fees, with 10% market penetration to hit $100M in ARR. We expect ACV to 2x in 5 years and SMEs to 100x in 10 years so our market penetration in 10 years would be 0.1%.\nBetter Approach: Calculate Lyft’s take rate on the GMV as revenue—GMV alone doesn’t reflect the value the company is capturing. Then, subtract the cost of delivering that revenue to calculate Lyft’s gross profit.\tBetter Approach: Many SaaS business models do not incur a lot of COGS. However, there are some mistakes to correct such as not breaking out annual recurring revenue vs. one-time revenue in your ACV and not including costs such as payment processing, customer support, hosting, etc.\nThe Bling Cap Approach\nAt Bling Capital, we believe your market sizing and narrative are interconnected. The exercise we often go through with founders are as follows:\n\nWhat do we need to believe for ‘Startup A’ to get to $100M and $500M, respectively, in gross profit?\n\nHow many customers (segmented) will you have and how much will they be paying you (annually)?\nWhat is the margin on your revenue (ideally by customer segment )?\nWhat percentage of the market does that represent? (essentially market share)*\nUsing the examples above, let’s go through market sizing for Lucidchart.\n\nWhat do we need to believe for Lucidchart to get to $100M and $500M in gross profit?\n\nWe segmented buyers based on company size. We have three tiers of buyers:\na. Tier 1 (Enterprise+) = 1000+ employee companies\nb. Tier 2 (Enterprise) = 100-1000 employee companies\nc. Tier 3 (SME) = 1-100 employee companies\nAcross all segments, there are 493K total companies in the US but we will focus on the 470K SME and Enterprise companies:\na. Tier 2: 75K companies (15%) are between 100-1000 employees\nb. Tier 3: 395K companies (80%) are between 10-100 employees\nWe have a SaaS freemium business model with 95% gross margins across segments. Our GTM is a product-led growth, with expansion driven by a sales organization.\na. Our goal average ACV for Tier 2 is $50K ($10K - $100K range), which is an average of 200 licenses per company per year ($250/year/license).\nb. Our goal average ACV for Tier 3 is $5K ($100-$20K range), which is an average of 50 licenses per company per year ($100/year).\nOur immediate revenue opportunity with our current product is $5.6B and our path to $100M is clear: We need 2K Tier 2 customers paying us $50K per year (~2.6% of market), or 20K Tier 3 customers paying us $5K per year (~5% of market).\na. Tier 2: $3.7B TAM\nb. Tier 3 $1.9B TAM\nOver time, as we launch more features (e.g., SSO), we will roll out to Tier 1 (Enterprise +) and implement playbooks to increase ACV across all segments. With just ~14% market penetration in this $9B TAM, we can reach $500M per year.\na. Tier 1: 23K * $150K = $3.4B (3.3K companies, or ~14%)\nb. Tier 2: 75K * $50K = $3.7B (10K companies, or ~12.5%)\nc. Tier 3: 395K * $5K = $1.9B (100K companies, or ~25%)\nAs extra credit, further segmenting their customer tiers based on actual or projected data points (e.g., engineering, product, design, marketing teams are core users for Lucidchart) shows an even deeper understanding of your market.\nApply It\nWhen going through a market sizing exercise with entrepreneurs, we usually start with asking questions. These questions are meant to help founders segment their customers, understand and assess reasonableness of their own assumptions, and to sanity check whether the story makes sense – all of which will lead to inputs for building a venture scale business.\n\nLet’s do this together: Create a Google Doc and answer the following questions:\n\nWho is the customer (or title of customer, or buyer), today AND tomorrow? These can be customers you serve today or, if you have not launched, customers you intend to serve.\nWhat are the segments in your market where this customer exists? Divide your market into segments and define them.\nHow many of these customers exist per segment? What are the number of customers that are model customers in each segment? Does that change over time?\nWhat were they doing before?\nWhat is the hair on fire problem?\nWhat are they doing now?\nHow is this 10x better?\nHow do you get them to pay you?\nHow much are they paying you / will they pay you? This should be your GMV, average order value (AOV), or average contract value (ACV) per customer per year.\nWhat is the cost of delivering that revenue? Does that change over time?\nWhat is the gross profit total for each segment? Does that change over time?\nHow many customers do you need to get to $100M and $500M in gross profit, and what percentage of the market (per segment) does that represent?\nThen, show the path to do that (In one sentence, clearly summarize how big of a revenue opportunity we believe this to be for us in Year 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). How many customers in your market do you already have as customers or are currently talking to? How do you plan to get your first 10-100, 100-1000 customers (or 10x, 100x or 1000x your current customer base) at the current or future GMV, AOV, ACV?\nWith the answers to these questions, you should have inputs for your “business formula”, using our Market Sizing Template. We’re excited to see what you produce!\n\nFinal Takeaway\nMarket sizing helps you create a holistic and compelling narrative about your business, one that will resonate with investors and help you sharpen how you talk and think about your product evolution. Taking the time to deeply evaluate your market size with a solid methodology can be a key part of crafting a strong narrative.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n[1] Consider these questions when segmenting your markets for a location-based GTM strategy: Is it by city or metro area? What is the characteristic of cities in each segment? How many cities exist in each segment? How much market penetration do you think you can realistically achieve in every market? When do you consider a city “activated” or “unlocked”?What is the TAM per city? How many cities in each segment do we need to unlock in order to achieve $100M and $500M in gross profit?\n\n[2] Consider these questions when segmenting your customers for a subscription product: Do you sell top-down to businesses or through a bottoms-up product-led-growth (PLG) motion? Who is your ideal customer profile? Is it different from the buyer? At what size company does your buyer differ? What is the size of the company by number of employees? Can we organize these companies by segment? How many companies exist per segment? How much will they pay us and does it differ by segment? How will sales and marketing differ per segment? How much market penetration do you think you can realistically achieve in every logo per segment to achieve $100M and $500M in gross profit?\n\n[3] Consider these questions when thinking about location-based GTM expansion and penetration: Which tier(s) will you focus on first? What is the hypothetical cost to launch a model city in each tier? How long would it take to hypothetically payback a model city in each tier? What is the reasonable goal penetration per model city in each tier? How many cities in each tier do you need to achieve $100M and $500M in gross profit? How do you anticipate growth over the next few years? Is this a small or large percentage of the total market? Is there room for more than one winner?\n\n[4] Consider these questions when thinking about subscription GTM expansion and penetration: Which segment(s) will you focus on first? Will you be using a sales team and if so for which segments? How will sales and marketing channels differ per segment? What is the hypothetical cost to close a model logo in each segment? How long would it take to hypothetically payback a model logo in each segment? What is the goal penetration per model logo in each segment (e.g., x employees / seats per logo)? What is the path to achieving $100M and $500M in gross profit? How do you anticipate growth over the next few years towards these revenue goals? is this a small or large percentage of the total market? Is there room for more than one winner?\n\n[5] Consider these segmentations for subscription businesses: Segment customers into logo size segments of SME (<10 employees), Enterprise (11-1000 employees), and Enterprise + (1000+ employees). Then, each segment’s logos should be assigned an ACV based on some reasonable assumptions; calculate total ACV per segment type as $xy, with x being the number of companies in the segment.\n\n", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}
/* Market Sizing Guide AUGUST 3, 2021 FUNDRAISING SHARE: icon linkedin icon twitter Pear VC Market Sizing Guide A startup’s potential scale is bound by its future market size, and consequently “what is your market size?” is one of the determining questions that most VCs ask early stage entrepreneurs. Why does market size matter? How to estimate your market size? What is the exact definition of market size? When should market size be estimated for? If you only take a few things from this article: Big companies can only exist in big markets. Estimate market size using a bottom-up approach not top-down. In other words, multiply the number of customers by the average revenue per customer per year (which you can estimate through multiplying transaction volume by price). Present your total addressable market and your future revenue for 5+ years into the future. At Pear we consider an entrepreneur’s clarity of thought and enduring ambition as more important than the market size number in a pitch deck. The objective of market sizing is to demonstrate that you are targeting a big market opportunity that you understand deeply. Startups have many unknowns and market sizing is a rough estimation, so keep it simple. 1. Why does market size matter? Big companies can only exist in big markets. Founder perspective: If you want to build a company that has a DoorDash-sized impact on the world then make sure to commit yourself to a sufficiently large market opportunity. Investor perspective: If you want to raise capital from VCs then you need to convince them that your company will generate an exit value that returns their fund. In your pitch you should aim to convey that your startup has the potential to capture at least hundreds of millions of dollars of high-margin revenue within the next decade, within a multiple billion dollar market. 2. How to estimate market size? Use the bottom-up approach to estimate market size. Multiply the number of customers by the average revenue per customer per year. There are top-down and bottom-up approaches to estimating market size. The bottom-up approach is more convincing because its uses assumptions that are substantiated through other aspects of your pitch, such as customer definition, revenue model, and GTM. VCs also prefer bottom-up because the underlying assumptions can be tested and validated. Ideally you will only use top-down to sanity check the magnitude of your bottom-up estimate. Keep your method simple and easy to explain. The underlying assumptions for market sizing will remain rough until you have ascertained your exact target customers and revenue model, so avoid undue complexity. 3. What is the exact definition of market size? There is no single definition of market size. Early stage companies typically present three estimates for TAM / SAM / SOM. I encourage you to skip the acronyms and present bottom-up estimates for your total addressable market and your revenue in 5+ years. We surveyed 30 VCs to better understand how other investors evaluate a startup’s potential scale. We learned that earlier stage investors tend to prefer market sizing presented as TAM / SAM / SOM, whereas later stage investors care more about recent revenue growth as well as estimates for future revenue. Seed VCs generally value TAM estimates more because they have limited additional information to inform decisions. We heard from seed investors that: “TAM / SAM / SOM works fine as long as the methodology is clear.” Series A VCs told us that they care more about future revenue even when looking at seed stage startups: “A bottom-up build of future revenue is more useful than basing SOM on a hypothetical % share of TAM or SAM.” Growth-stage VCs pay less attention to market sizing and we heard that: “TAM is a crude indicator. Revenue growth is a better signal. It’s hard to grow 200% at scale if there’s a small TAM.” The textbook definitions for TAM / SAM / SOM are vague. You might have seen TAM / SAM / SOM in an article or a pitch deck. If you Google these acronyms and read a few testing_articles then you’ll likely find varying fuzzy explanations (one example depicted below). Pitch decks often include a market sizing illustrated as three bold numbers within three concentric circles, without context or assumptions. Such minimalism saves one from committing to definitions that we might be unsure about, but it also forfeits this opportunity to present a compelling narrative that convinces investors. Based on our survey of 30 VCs, it seems that many investors do not know the exact definitions either. So when presenting your market sizing, explicitly state your methodology rather than assume universal definitions.  (These survey results also had me wondering whether later stage VCs are more honest about their knowledge gaps! ) The textbook estimation approach for TAM / SAM / SOM is TOP DOWN ⚠️ Marketing textbooks generally describe the TAM / SAM / SOM approach as: first estimate your largest possible market for $ TAM, of which estimate a narrower proportion that fits your company for $ SAM, and then estimate the % market share you can reach to get to $ SOM. However, the % market share assumption is often an unsubstantiated afterthought, which results in a meaningless estimate for your company’s potential revenue. This approach encourages top-down thinking and is unconvincing. The most consistent feedback in our VC survey was to dissuade founders from presenting their future revenue based on % market share of a large addressable market. So, what’s a better approach? Present bottom-up estimates for your total addressable market and for your revenue in 5 years. The market sizing definitions stated below are based on consensus across surveyed VCs. However, interpretation still varies so state your assumptions. Also, enough with the acronyms — replace the jargon with more meaningful descriptors. Some of the surveyed VCs encouraged founders to drop the conceptual distinction between TAM and SAM. However, opinions on this topic were mixed. Instead of presenting both TAM and SAM, you could communicate your plan for incremental expansion across customer segments and products. eg. Start with an initial wedge of selling product A into customer segment X. Then expand through cross-selling product B into the same customer segment X. Followed by expanding further through selling products A and B to a new customer segment Y. 4. When should market size be estimated for? Estimate your market size for 5+ years into the future. Surveyed VCs most commonly wanted to see market size estimates for 5 years into the future. If your company is many years away from IPO and/or riding a longterm industry trend (eg. transition to electric vehicles) then it’s more appropriate to estimate 7-10 years into the future. A significant proportion of the VCs surveyed also prefer to see market size now as well as 5 years into the future. If you’re targeting a rapidly growing existing market then you can highlight that growth through presenting both now and in 5 years. Guidance on the underlying assumptions Now that you understand how to estimate your market size, you need to source the underlying assumptions to feed into the bottom-up equations. You can follow the following steps to arrive at assumptions for calculating total addressable market, initial addressable market, and future revenue. 1) # of Customers 1.1) Define your customers Precisely focus on the customer segment that will contribute the majority of your potential revenue. eg. While DoorDash could claim that every person in the US could potentially order food online, a more convincing segment might be: “Americans in the age range of 25-40, who are employed, and eat out at least once per week.” If level of demand and/or willingness to pay varies significantly across your customer-base then you should capture such variation in your estimation through customer segmentation. Though keep it simple and only consider segments that will contribute significant revenue. eg. Market sizing assumptions can differ significantly between SMB and Enterprise customers. If we’re selling a product into both then we should segment the market. (100K SMBs x 5 seats x $10K per seat = $5B) + (1K Enterprises x 100 seats x $20K per seat = $2B) = $7B total. 1.2) Estimate the total number of customers The most relevant data sources vary by business category, eg. Consumer: If you can define your target customer (or user) segment in terms of socio-demographics then use the US Census Bureau data on US Population. Vertical-specific B2B: You can identify the number of relevant companies within an industry vertical using US Census Bureau data on US Companies. Enterprise: If you your future revenue will be concentrated in big enterprise accounts then identify what proportion of companies within the Fortune100 or Fortune500 would buy for your product. Additional example data sources: Research reports (eg. Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey, BCG) Government agencies (eg. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, US SBA, trade.gov, Bureau of Transportation, Dept of Housing, US Dept of Agriculture) Industry bodies (eg. National Business Group on Health, National Restaurant Association, National Association of Realtors) NGOs (eg. UN Dept of Economic & Social Affairs, UN World Tourism) S-1s of companies in your category 1.3) Estimate the number of customers you could acquire in 5 years You will acquire only a proportion of total customers We need to estimate a realistic number of customers captured by around the time you IPO, so 5-10 years from today. Its best to build this bottom-up through considering how many new customers you’ll be able to acquire (and retain) per year over the next 5-10 years. Sense check your implied market share. Look at the market shares of existing dominant players in your category and in adjacent categories. Also consider strength of network effects, how entrenched established players are, and ease of distribution (eg. capturing 10% of the Fortune100 is more realistic than capturing 10% of 100,000 SMBs). Our expectations for high market shares are often anchored in the dominant consumer-facing FAANGs, yet many other categories are more fragmented or under-penetrated. Pitch decks often state a 10% potential market share. Yet when tech companies IPO they have typically only attained a 0.1% to 2% share of their addressable market. See the chart below based on data in S-1s of recent tech IPOs. 2) $ Avg Revenue per Customer per Year 2.1) Select your revenue model Identify the most relevant revenue model for your business. You might foresee multiple revenue streams, however its best to keep it simple and focus the market sizing on your core revenue stream.  See the table below for examples (though this is not an exhaustive list). Each revenue model is split into transaction volume multiplied by pricing. 2.2) Estimate Transaction Volume This requires you to understand your target customer’s behavior. (eg. How many product will they consumer per year, How much data storage will they require, How many seats per company, etc.) 2.3) Estimate Pricing Pricing is an artform worthy of volumes, and in practice you might chose to implement multi-tiered pricing differentiation to maximize your profits. But again, for estimating market size, minimize the complexity. There are three main approaches to pricing. Value-based pricing is generally the best approach. Value-based: Estimate how much value your customer attains from your product, and charge a proportion of that value. You can charge more through: (i) creating greater value for your customer; and/or (ii) heightening your customer’s perception of that value creation. Attribution is as important as the actual impact of your product. A rule as thumb is that you can charge in the range of 10-30% of the value you create for your customer. Competitor-based: If your industry has pre-existing comparable products to yours then your customers are likely anchored in pre-existing price ranges. When pitching to VCs you might need to explain why your product has a premium or a discount to comparable products. Cost-based: Estimate the cost to deliver your product and add a margin. Fixed costs are generally low in tech companies, and this is more relevant to operationally intensive and/or asset heavy companies. How to best apply these approaches varies by the business category, eg. B2B SaaS: Value-based pricing is the optimal approach to determine your customer willingness to pay. (eg. If your products increase your customer’s profits by $1M per year on a perpetual basis then you can charge a $100-300K per year subscription fee.) Consumer: Anchoring to the price of adjacent products often informs the attainable price, unless your brand is highly differentiated. This also applies to consumer fintech. (See this article) Healthcare: B2B healthcare solutions sold to payers or employers usually have a fee per member per month revenue model, and you can charge a proportion of the cost savings you deliver. D2C healthcare solutions usually a fee for service or a monthly subscription revenue model, and ideally you identify relevant reimbursement CPT codes. Healthcare also includes several more complex pricing models. Marketplaces: The % take rate in a marketplace is driven by how much demand you can drive to your customer and how much easier you make it to run their business, as well as how competitive your market is. (See Lenny’s newsletter) Now multiple those assumptions out. Hopefully you arrive at a big number for the addressable market. If not then revisit your assumptions as well as your overall vision. Additional Tips Think long-term and dream big. Most successful startups create or change markets, so you should estimate hypothetical demand for your product in 5-10 years, not just existing demand. Also consider how you will expand average revenue per customer through solving additional problems for your target customers. Global market size is rarely relevant. If your strategy is US-focused then state an addressable market for the US only. If you’re starting in a smaller country and your strategy focuses on multiple similar countries then state an addressable market for those countries and be ready to explain your international go-top-market plan. Ensure that the revenue you are presenting is annual. (eg. If there are 10M potential customers for your product and they might buy your product every two years on average, then you have 5M target customers per year. For marketplaces, include take rate in the market size calculation rather than presenting overall GMV. For financial products, include fees rather than presenting total transaction value or AUM. If your B2B startup is helping your customer to increase their profits, then you can only charge a proportion of that impact. Read S-1s of public companies with similar customers or products as your company. Search the SEC database for a public company of interest and open their ‘S-1 Prospectus’. S-1s are a goldmine of information and provide insights well beyond market sizing. */

Seed VCs generally value TAM estimates more because they have limited additional information to inform decisions. We heard from seed investors that: “TAM / SAM / SOM works fine as long as the methodology is clear.” Series A VCs told us that they care more about future revenue even when looking at seed stage startups: “A bottom-up build of future revenue is more useful than basing SOM on a hypothetical % share of TAM or SAM.” Growth-stage VCs pay less attention to market sizing and we heard that: “TAM is a crude indicator. Revenue growth is a better signal. It’s hard to grow 200% at scale if there’s a small TAM.” The textbook definitions for TAM / SAM / SOM are vague. You might have seen TAM / SAM / SOM in an article or a pitch deck. If you Google these acronyms and read a few articles then you’ll likely find varying fuzzy explanations (one example depicted below). Pitch decks often include a market sizing illustrated as three bold numbers within three concentric circles, without context or assumptions. Such minimalism saves one from committing to definitions that we might be unsure about, but it also forfeits this opportunity to present a compelling narrative that convinces investors. Based on our survey of 30 VCs, it seems that many investors do not know the exact definitions either. So when presenting your market sizing, explicitly state your methodology rather than assume universal definitions.  (These survey results also had me wondering whether later stage VCs are more honest about their knowledge gaps! ) The textbook estimation approach for TAM / SAM / SOM is TOP DOWN ⚠️ Marketing textbooks generally describe the TAM / SAM / SOM approach as: first estimate your largest possible market for $ TAM, of which estimate a narrower proportion that fits your company for $ SAM, and then estimate the % market share you can reach to get to $ SOM. However, the % market share assumption is often an unsubstantiated afterthought, which results in a meaningless estimate for your company’s potential revenue. This approach encourages top-down thinking and is unconvincing. The most consistent feedback in our VC survey was to dissuade founders from presenting their future revenue based on % market share of a large addressable market. So, what’s a better approach? Present bottom-up estimates for your total addressable market and for your revenue in 5 years. The market sizing definitions stated below are based on consensus across surveyed VCs. However, interpretation still varies so state your assumptions. Also, enough with the acronyms — replace the jargon with more meaningful descriptors. Some of the surveyed VCs encouraged founders to drop the conceptual distinction between TAM and SAM. However, opinions on this topic were mixed. Instead of presenting both TAM and SAM, you could communicate your plan for incremental expansion across customer segments and products. eg. Start with an initial wedge of selling product A into customer segment X. Then expand through cross-selling product B into the same customer segment X. Followed by expanding further through selling products A and B to a new customer segment Y. 4. When should market size be estimated for? Estimate your market size for 5+ years into the future. Surveyed VCs most commonly wanted to see market size estimates for 5 years into the future. If your company is many years away from IPO and/or riding a longterm industry trend (eg. transition to electric vehicles) then it’s more appropriate to estimate 7-10 years into the future. A significant proportion of the VCs surveyed also prefer to see market size now as well as 5 years into the future. If you’re targeting a rapidly growing existing market then you can highlight that growth through presenting both now and in 5 years. Guidance on the underlying assumptions Now that you understand how to estimate your market size, you need to source the underlying assumptions to feed into the bottom-up equations. You can follow the following steps to arrive at assumptions for calculating total addressable market, initial addressable market, and future revenue. 1) # of Customers 1.1) Define your customers Precisely focus on the customer segment that will contribute the majority of your potential revenue. eg. While DoorDash could claim that every person in the US could potentially order food online, a more convincing segment might be: “Americans in the age range of 25-40, who are employed, and eat out at least once per week.” If level of demand and/or willingness to pay varies significantly across your customer-base then you should capture such variation in your estimation through customer segmentation. Though keep it simple and only consider segments that will contribute significant revenue. eg. Market sizing assumptions can differ significantly between SMB and Enterprise customers. If we’re selling a product into both then we should segment the market. (100K SMBs x 5 seats x $10K per seat = $5B) + (1K Enterprises x 100 seats x $20K per seat = $2B) = $7B total. 1.2) Estimate the total number of customers The most relevant data sources vary by business category, eg. Consumer: If you can define your target customer (or user) segment in terms of socio-demographics then use the US Census Bureau data on US Population. Vertical-specific B2B: You can identify the number of relevant companies within an industry vertical using US Census Bureau data on US Companies. Enterprise: If you your future revenue will be concentrated in big enterprise accounts then identify what proportion of companies within the Fortune100 or Fortune500 would buy for your product. Additional example data sources: Research reports (eg. Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey, BCG) Government agencies (eg. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, US SBA, trade.gov, Bureau of Transportation, Dept of Housing, US Dept of Agriculture) Industry bodies (eg. National Business Group on Health, National Restaurant Association, National Association of Realtors) NGOs (eg. UN Dept of Economic & Social Affairs, UN World Tourism) S-1s of companies in your category 1.3) Estimate the number of customers you could acquire in 5 years You will acquire only a proportion of total customers We need to estimate a realistic number of customers captured by around the time you IPO, so 5-10 years from today. Its best to build this bottom-up through considering how many new customers you’ll be able to acquire (and retain) per year over the next 5-10 years. Sense check your implied market share. Look at the market shares of existing dominant players in your category and in adjacent categories. Also consider strength of network effects, how entrenched established players are, and ease of distribution (eg. capturing 10% of the Fortune100 is more realistic than capturing 10% of 100,000 SMBs). Our expectations for high market shares are often anchored in the dominant consumer-facing FAANGs, yet many other categories are more fragmented or under-penetrated. Pitch decks often state a 10% potential market share. Yet when tech companies IPO they have typically only attained a 0.1% to 2% share of their addressable market. See the chart below based on data in S-1s of recent tech IPOs. 2) $ Avg Revenue per Customer per Year 2.1) Select your revenue model Identify the most relevant revenue model for your business. You might foresee multiple revenue streams, however its best to keep it simple and focus the market sizing on your core revenue stream.  See the table below for examples (though this is not an exhaustive list). Each revenue model is split into transaction volume multiplied by pricing. 2.2) Estimate Transaction Volume This requires you to understand your target customer’s behavior. (eg. How many product will they consumer per year, How much data storage will they require, How many seats per company, etc.) 2.3) Estimate Pricing Pricing is an artform worthy of volumes, and in practice you might chose to implement multi-tiered pricing differentiation to maximize your profits. But again, for estimating market size, minimize the complexity. There are three main approaches to pricing. Value-based pricing is generally the best approach. Value-based: Estimate how much value your customer attains from your product, and charge a proportion of that value. You can charge more through: (i) creating greater value for your customer; and/or (ii) heightening your customer’s perception of that value creation. Attribution is as important as the actual impact of your product. A rule as thumb is that you can charge in the range of 10-30% of the value you create for your customer. Competitor-based: If your industry has pre-existing comparable products to yours then your customers are likely anchored in pre-existing price ranges. When pitching to VCs you might need to explain why your product has a premium or a discount to comparable products. Cost-based: Estimate the cost to deliver your product and add a margin. Fixed costs are generally low in tech companies, and this is more relevant to operationally intensive and/or asset heavy companies. How to best apply these approaches varies by the business category, eg. B2B SaaS: Value-based pricing is the optimal approach to determine your customer willingness to pay. (eg. If your products increase your customer’s profits by $1M per year on a perpetual basis then you can charge a $100-300K per year subscription fee.) Consumer: Anchoring to the price of adjacent products often informs the attainable price, unless your brand is highly differentiated. This also applies to consumer fintech. (See this article) Healthcare: B2B healthcare solutions sold to payers or employers usually have a fee per member per month revenue model, and you can charge a proportion of the cost savings you deliver. D2C healthcare solutions usually a fee for service or a monthly subscription revenue model, and ideally you identify relevant reimbursement CPT codes. Healthcare also includes several more complex pricing models. Marketplaces: The % take rate in a marketplace is driven by how much demand you can drive to your customer and how much easier you make it to run their business, as well as how competitive your market is. (See Lenny’s newsletter) Now multiple those assumptions out. Hopefully you arrive at a big number for the addressable market. If not then revisit your assumptions as well as your overall vision. Additional Tips Think long-term and dream big. Most successful startups create or change markets, so you should estimate hypothetical demand for your product in 5-10 years, not just existing demand. Also consider how you will expand average revenue per customer through solving additional problems for your target customers. Global market size is rarely relevant. If your strategy is US-focused then state an addressable market for the US only. If you’re starting in a smaller country and your strategy focuses on multiple similar countries then state an addressable market for those countries and be ready to explain your international go-top-market plan. Ensure that the revenue you are presenting is annual. (eg. If there are 10M potential customers for your product and they might buy your product every two years on average, then you have 5M target customers per year. For marketplaces, include take rate in the market size calculation rather than presenting overall GMV. For financial products, include fees rather than presenting total transaction value or AUM. If your B2B startup is helping your customer to increase their profits, then you can only charge a proportion of that impact. Read S-1s of public companies with similar customers or products as your company. Search the SEC database for a public company of interest and open their ‘S-1 Prospectus’. S-1s are a goldmine of information and provide insights well beyond market sizing.", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "VC Guide to Market Sizing\nSean Stuart\nStartup Stash\nSean Stuart\n\n·\nFollow\n\nPublished in\nStartup Stash\n\n·\n5 min read\n·\nSep 6, 2022\n110\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nMarkets are a fairly ancient concept but sizing them is not.\n\nVC: Your market is not big enough.\n\nFounder: Wait, but a million people will want it…\n\nVC: Yeah, but they will only ever pay $100 each.\n\nFounder: What’s wrong with that…\n\nVC:\n\n\nQuick recap: a market exists when there are a group of customers willing to pay money for a product. Its potential size is therefore equal to the # of potential customers x the average revenue per account (ARPA).\n\nThis is the total addressable market (TAM) for that product.\n\nThe first question is how a TAM could possibly be too small for a VC if there was a $100 million opportunity. Sadly, the answer is a bit more depressing than we would think.\n\nMost startups die.\n\nThere are a multitude of risks involved in creating a company — technical risk, execution risk and product risk, to name a few. Importantly, risk is not proportional to the size of the market. Just because a market is small does not mean the likelihood of success of that startup is any greater than a startup pursuing an enormous opportunity.\n\nIt’s counterintuitive and difficult to process as a founder because you view your company as a certainty. The VC does not, they view you as a portfolio. And they know that statistically many of their companies will fail, but the ones that do win, will return all the profits.\n\nSo, if they predict the expected value of your company, it is equal to the probability of success x potential valuation.\n\nThe easiest proxy for investors is to assume that the level of risk/probability of success is mostly constant for all investments BUT the potential valuation is a variable that is derived from TAM.\n\nSay the TAM is $100M. A reasonable assumption is that if you win the market, you will obtain 25% market share. Applying a revenue multiple of 10x, your company would be worth $250M.\n\nA great outcome?\n\nWell yes, if this was a 100% certain, but it’s not.\n\nThe VC knows it’s downside is capped at the cost of each investment, but it needs to make its potential upside as large as possible for the model to work.\n\nThe VC will generally only choose companies with the potential to be unicorns or return their funds. Generally, this means a company needs to be able to obtain around $100M in ARR, as 10x multiple would give a billion-dollar valuation.\n\n\nGiven these calculations are so rough, some investors question the purpose of even doing them:\n\n\nNote: Investors that are infinitely more accomplished think they are futile.\n\nThat being said, data suggests that their approach would be misguided. Sizing TAM does matter, but only to a point.\n\n\nNearly 88% of billion-dollar companies surveyed started with a medium to large size TAM at the time of founding.\n\nHowever, many would be quick to point out that the biggest outlier companies are the ones that start in very small markets and grow exponentially, e.g., personal computers in the 70s and the internet in the 90s.\n\nThat’s why it’s imperative to understand the acceleration of a market. Acceleration of markets is caused by:\n\nTechnology changes,\nDistribution channels changes,\nConsumer behaviour changes, or\nRegulation changes.\nIf there is strong evidence of one of these changes at play, then sizing TAM may be futile because it can be difficult to predict and factor in exponential growth.\n\nBut if the market of buyers is relatively constant and the pain point clearly defined, sizing TAM is useful.\n\nFor example, if you are a cemetery software company that sells to cemeteries, the TAM is likely to be fairly constant in the absence of some cataclysmic apocalypse.\n\nTherefore, sizing TAM is good when the following ingredients are at play:\n\nThe group of buyers is clearly defined (e.g., # number of people who drink coffee), and\nThe pain point is well established (CRM software for sales teams).\nSizing TAM is properly futile when:\n\nStructural changes are exponentially growing TAM (technology, distribution, consumer behaviour, regulation), and\nThe product is so much cheaper than existing solutions that it expands an existing market by orders of magnitude (e.g. Uber vs Taxis).\nAll of the mistakes investors make in sizing TAM will come from assuming a group of buyers is fairly constant without realising that a structural force is exponentially expanding the universe of buyers.\n\nThe internet is just for hobbyists, it could never be for businesses.\n\nCrypto is for technologists, it will never be for the masses.\n\nSo, being reductive, the only question that matters when sizing markets is: is this a small market that is about to grow exponentially?\n\nIf it is, market sizing won’t help.\n\nIf it’s not, market sizing might help.\n\nWhile imperfect, I like using heuristics to tell if there are signs that it is a small market about to grow exponentially.\n\nFirst, I identify the structural change.\n\nThen I assess the strength of fanaticism from the early adopters. If people have a cult like following of a particular product, there may be signs the compounding is about to begin.\n\nAnother cheeky heuristic is to listen to all the reasons why experts think the product will be a failure and won’t work for a wider market.\n\nCrypto will never get mass adoption because gas fees are too high.\n\nThe internet will never have e-commerce because people won’t put their credit card details online.\n\nThis is a proxy that can tell you where to invest next. Generally, all their criticisms are valid, and they show you the opportunities to solve to reach mass adoption.\n\nHigh Gas Fees = Optimism, Immutable X\n\nE-commerce lacks trust = Amazon, Paypal\n\nThis is why VCs attempt to size markets.", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "How to Conduct a Market Sizing Analysis\nWhy and how to assess market potential\n\nZEB HASTINGS\nOCT 20, 2020\n\nWhen considering an investment, it's essential to understand the size of the opportunity. To find this information, both VCs and founders will conduct an exercise called market sizing. This post will define what market sizing is, why investors and founders benefit from it, and some approaches.\n\nWhat is market sizing?\nMarket sizing is relatively straightforward. The basic principle is that it calculates the potential market demand for a company's products. \n\nWhy is market sizing important?\nFor investors, market sizing determines whether or not an opportunity is worth pursuing. VCs are looking for \"outsized returns\" and therefore need to invest in a company that can grow revenues enough to have an exit eventually. In general, VCs would like to be investing in a market worth at least $1B.\n\nFor founders, knowing a market opportunity and customers will dictate the go-to-market strategy and business planning. Having these elements in place will help them determine their revenue goals and fundraising objectives. As venture capital should be used as a runway to hit specific milestones, these figures will help founders and investors determine a company's potential for successful growth, valuation, and the capital needed to achieve each milestone.\n\nHow to size a market\nWhen looking at the traditional way to size up a market, investors need to focus on three components:\n\nTAM (Total Addressable Market): This is the total market for a product and includes everyone who could buy your product, regardless of other market factors such as competition.\n\nSAM (Serviceable Addressable Market): This is a portion of TAM that a company can acquire. For example, if your product is only available in English, you probably wouldn't be able to go after the Latin American market.\n\nSOM (Share of Market): This is your existing customer base or a percentage of SAM that you can realistically expect to acquire.\n\n\nPhoto Source\n\nFor more detailed information on these, Hubspot has a good blog about them here.\n\nThere are two approaches to size up a market properly:\n\nTop-Down: This approach is a broad and quick way to look at a market. In a top-down approach, you would start with the largest size possible and use analysis, information, and assumptions about our business and the demand to reduce it to a reasonable estimate.\n\nBottom-Up: This approach is more detailed and time-consuming. In a bottom-up analysis, you use your company's data (product, price, customer, competition) and scale up from there.\n\nIn general, bottom-up is a more accurate assessment of your market. A best practice is to perform both calculations to validate your thinking.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of these two approaches, this link provides an informative example.\n\nBeyond traditional market sizing, new approaches have been proposed. The TAM Onion is one such approach, starting with your spearhead market and expanding outward.\n\n\nPhoto Source\n\nTo learn more about this method, check out Samir Ghosh’s blog on it here.\n\nFinal thoughts\nMarket sizing is crucial for all businesses and investors. Knowing your market lays down the foundation for the entire company and investment strategy. There are many assumptions to make when conducting this exercise, and there is a fair amount of creativity involved. Market sizing can be difficult for early-stage companies, and even more so for startups creating a brand new market (think Uber or Airbnb). Try different approaches, and make sure you understand both your business and your customers. As the company moves further along and gathers more data, the exercise becomes more comfortable and accurate.", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "Everything You Need to Know About Market Sizing\nOctober 17, 2022\nWritten By Alex Iskold\nI consistently see founders get MARKET SIZE wrong in the early stage decks.\n\nAt the same time, VCs often pass if they feel that the market is TOO SMALL.\n\nHere is everything you ever needed to know about MARKET SIZING.\n\nSO, WHAT IS MARKET SIZE ANYWAY?\nMarket size is the amount of money your prospective customers spend. \n\nFor example, cloud computing market is $1,600 BN by 2030\n\nOr Healthcare & Heath Ins in USA is $1.1 T\n\nWHY DO VCs CARE SO MUCH ABOUT MARKET SIZE?\nVCs want to only invest in big markets. The reason is simple: \n\nVenture scale return on a company is > $100M in Revenue \n\nSay you are in a $1B market, to get to $100M in revenue you need to capture 10% of this market. That's hard.\n\nMost markets are NOT winner take all. Think Uber and Lyft -- they compete. Space X and Blue Origin -- compete, etc \n\nMost markets are CROWDED.\n\nIn a crowded market, revenue opportunity shrinks - pie is split.\n\nVCs don't want to invest in a small market because it will likely be a small outcome.\n\nVCs rely on power law - big outliers - to make their math work. Small outcomes aren't good for them!\n\nTOP DOWN MARKET SIZE\nThere are two ways people look at the market size - TOP DOWN and BOTTOM UP. \n\nTOP DOWN is what founders mostly put in their decks and it is typically incorrect for two reasons. \n\nA) It’s way too big \n\nB) It’s not even their market.\n\nLets look at some examples.\n\nSay you are launching a new cloud based database for machine learning. If you put an entire $1,600 B market for cloud tools as your market size, this is INCORRECT - you are WAY OVERESTIMATING it. \n\nYou are NOT proving all cloud tools.\n\nSimilarly, if you put $189B - size of ML tools, you are still over estimating it. \n\nThere are MANY tools for ML and data layer is only 1 piece of the puzzle, one slice of the market!\n\nEven worse than over estimating is claiming the totally wrong market. \n\nFor example, if you are selling digital software in the healthcare industry, NEVER put $1.1 T spent on Healthcare in US in your deck. NEVER. \n\nIt is completely IRRELEVANT!\n\nIf you are selling digital software in the healthcare industry, even $185B for Digital Health market IS NOT YOUR MARKET SIZE.  Your market is Medical Software which is somewhere between $10B and $20B, and thats not all...\n\nUltimately your startup is going after a sliver of that market. \n\nSo you need to really drill down! \n\nFor example, if you are selling to dentists it is $1 - $2B market for entire amount they spend on managing their practice.\n\nIn general, TOP DOWN MARKET SIZE is NOT VERY USEFUL, but ... \n\nGoogle YOUR SPECIFIC MARKET \n\nResearch revenue / market cap of larger companies in the space \n\nTrim down and be conservative \n\nEstimate you can capture 1-10% MAX!\n\nBOTTOM UP MARKET SIZE\nBottom up is a MUCH BETTER approach, especially for early stage founders who need to build credibility with investors. \n\nIt is also A LOT simpler. \n\nMarket size = # Of Customers X Revenue Per Customer. \n\nHere some examples.\n\nThere are 180,000 dental practices in the US. If you sell them software for $500 MRR or $6K ARR you are going after 180,000 X $6,000 = $1B in opportunity. To get to $100M in ARR you need to sell to 10% or 18,000 dental practices - and keep them!\n\nLet's look at another example - Netflix. \n\n$20 a month or $240 ARR, assuming they sell to each of the 120M households in the US, Netflix can get $28.8B. Sanity check, it is currently at $7B in the US or about 1/4 of the total market.\n\nAnother example - something that looks to be a small market.\n\nSay we are selling SaaS tools to universities in the US at $100K ARR -- which is a nice size contract. \n\nThere are 5,000 universities so $500M market. \n\nMost, if not all, VCs will consider it too small.\n\nQUICK HACK FOR MARKET SIZING \nLets go back to the formula: \n\nMarket size = # Of Customers x Revenue per Customer.\n\nTo get to a big number you need either:\n\nA LOT OF CUSTOMERS who PAY A LITTLE or A FEW CUSTOMERS who PAY A LOT. \n\nHack - use Netflix as a baseline \n\n100M households paying $10 a month.\n\nOrder of magnitude for Netflix is $10B - venture size market. \n\nLearn to quickly shift zeros from left to right. \n\nExample: \n\n100,000 restaurants in the US => Each would need to pay you $10K a month to get the same $10B market - Impossible!\n\nVCs love > $10B+ markets. \n\nVCs don't like < $1B markets. \n\nIf you know how many customers you COULD HAVE (Google it!) and you know how much they would pay (ASK THEM!!!) then you know exactly where you would fit.\n\nThere is NO EXCUSE whatsoever to not get the BOTTOM UP MARKET SIZE right. \n\nStop using TAM / crazy out of this world numbers that have NOTHING TO DO with your business numbers in your decks. \n\nUse BOTTOM UP MARKET SIZE & get it right!\n\nSHRINKING OR GROWING MARKET?\nAnother thing to know about the market is if it is EXPANDING. \n\nFor example, EV Market => Expanding, Gasoline based vehicles -- shrinking! \n\nVCs love quickly growing markets - forward looking. \n\nVCs dislike shrinking markets - backward looking.\n\nThis gets tricky... Digital Health - Growing! \n\nTraditional Health -- Likely Shrinking! \n\nOverall education - Growing! \n\nTraditional education - Likely Shrinking! \n\nVCs are going to get into the weeds!\n\nNOT A VENTURE SCALE MARKET? NO PROBLEM!!\nSome founders get upset hearing that their market is too small, but the best founders DO NOT CARE!\n\nBest founders are on a MISSION to solve a problem, not to generate venture scale returns. Those two don't always align!\n\nIf you are passionate about a small market you should still go and build a business!\n\nYou can still raise capital, structure it smartly, and grow through the best $ out there - CUSTOMER REVENUE!\n\nVCs are NOTORIOUSLY WRONG about market size. Even Uber and Airbnb initially were told their markets are too small \uD83D\uDE02.\n\nThe best founders can EXPAND MARKETS. They see the future the way others can't. \n\nDon't be deterred!\n\nSUMMARY\nVCs are RIGHT to care about MARKET SIZE\nAvoid including a HUGE RANDOM TAM # in your deck\nDo research and use BOTTOM UP MARKET SIZE\nEven if the market is small but you are passionate - GO FOR IT! What VCs think DOES NOT MATTER!", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "How To Effectively Determine Your Market Size\nAlejandro Cremades\nFormer Contributor\nAuthor of The Art of Startup Fundraising & Serial Entrepreneur\n\nSep 23, 2018,07:59am EDT\nThis article is more than 5 years old.\nPixabay\nPixabay PIXABAY\nOne of the most crucial tasks an entrepreneur has is to calculate the size of their market, and the potential value that market has for their startup business. Without this data you can’t create a viable business plan, or be taken seriously when approaching potential investors.\n\nAs described in my book, The Art of Startup Fundraising, the market needs to be in the billions. Otherwise, even if you have the perfect team and product the returns will be limited for potential investors making your investment opportunity less attractive.\n\nMarket Size for Startups\n\nDetermining the market size is critical. It tells you and your partners, team and investors how much potential business is really out there. It helps calculate how much value there really is for your individual venture. This is critical to know, even if you never plan to raise a dime in outside capital.\n\nMarket size becomes far more important if you ever need to raise funding for your business. It is one of the most basic digits every potential angel and VC investor is going to expect. Even your friends and family should be asking about it during seed and pre-seed financing rounds. Coming up empty handed is going to destroy your credibility instantly.\n\nUnfortunately, this is one factor which entrepreneurs frequently blow when formulating initial plans, stepping out into a new business and when pitching investors. So, how do you do it right?\n\nHow to Determine Market Size\n\nTo calculate your market size, you’ll either be looking for data on the number of potential customer, or number of transactions each year.\n\n\nCEO: C-suite news, analysis, and advice for top decision makers right to your inbox.\n\nEmail address\nSign Up\nBy signing up, you accept and agree to our Terms of Service (including the class action waiver and arbitration provisions), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement. Forbes is protected by reCAPTCHA, and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nFor example; if you are selling toothbrushes, virtually everyone can be counted in your big whole market figure. If people are listening to their dentists, and they are purchasing new toothbrushes 2-4 times per year, that number is even larger. If you are selling houses, then there may only be an average of 5.34M transactions in a good year, in the entire United States.\n\nThe Art of Startup Fundraising book\nThe Art of Startup Fundraising book THE ART OF STARTUP FUNDRAISING BOOK\n\nKeep in mind: \n\nShow projections going out 3 years (it’s hard to accurately analyze after that)\nAccount for organic growth or decline in the years ahead\nYour roll out to geographic areas over time\nThere are a variety of ways to acquire this data. Census and labor bureau hold a lot of information, and most industries have formal associations which compile and track this type of data. You can also commission your own research or purchase studies.\n\nOnce you have the data you want to make sure that you are presenting it in a powerful way in your pitch deck since it is one of the most important slides. A good pitch deck template is the one created by Silicon Valley legend, Peter Thiel (see it here) that I recently covered. Thiel was the first angel investor in Facebook with a $500K check that turned into more than $1 billion in cash. Thiel actually includes not one, but two slides around the market and its size. Moreover, I also provided a commentary on a pitch deck from an Uber competitor that has raised over $400M (see it here).\n\nBelow is another example of how to show in your pitch deck your market growing over time.\n\nThe Art of Startup Fundraising book\nThe Art of Startup Fundraising book THE ART OF STARTUP FUNDRAISING BOOK\n\nHow to Determine Market Value\n\nMarket size, or the number of potential customers or unit sales is one thing. How much that is worth, is a completely different, and perhaps more important figure.\n\nYou need to know how much revenue that market has to offer. For example; UpNest is one of the fastest growing real estate tech startups, which helps home buyers and sellers save on Realtor commissions. If the average home price is $394,300, and there are 5M sales per year, and the average Realtor commission is 5% of the sales price, and 90% of users use a Realtor, UpNest is in an $88.7B per year industry. Or has a market size of $88.7B.\n\nDetermining Total Addressable Market (TAM)\n\nRealistically, no startup should or can expect to gain 100% market share.

The company’s CEO recently said that if it could acquire 275,000 units a $3,500 profit each, it would be doing very well. That’s about $1B a year from just one extra revenue stream, at just over 18% of the available market share.\n\nOf course, most new startups can’t expect to even command that much market share.

{"prompt": "\nSizing Up: Market Sizing for Your Business\nDo you know your market size? Knowing market size can help you figure out how big is your business relative to the market, and how much potential it has. Here’s how to figure out market size.\nOutlier AI\nTowards Data Science\nOutlier AI\n\n·\nFollow\n\nPublished in\nTowards Data Science\n\n·\n8 min read\n·\nAug 25, 2017\n509\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nHow big is your market?\nOne of the first things an investor considers before investing in your business is how big is your market. Your total addressable market (TAM) is how big your business could theoretically become if it were to own 100% of its market — if every possible customer was a customer of your company and you had no competition. This is an important consideration because the larger the market the larger the business can become!\n\nObviously, few businesses will ever come close to 100% market share and the TAM is a yardstick used to compare different businesses instead of a measure of a specific business. If you are considering investing in a business with a TAM of $10M and another with a TAM of $100M, the latter company has more potential because its market is larger. If you assume a successful business might own 10% of their TAM (much more realistic than 100%) then it becomes easier to compare these businesses since $1M < $10M.\n\nBut how do you figure out your TAM? What if you are a new business who does not yet understand fully who your customers will be? What if you are in a new market that is growing and changing every day?\n\nThis week we’ll cover techniques and considerations for sizing your TAM. Specifically:\n\nPart 2 — Top Down Market Sizing\nPart 3 — Bottom Up Market Sizing\nPart 4 — Using Comparables\nPart 5 — Sizing a New Market\nAs you’ll see, market sizing requires a significant amount of creativity on your part since you will need to make many assumptions to create an estimate. We will get started with Top Down market sizing next.\n\nStarting from the top\n\nOur first approach to estimating your total addressable market (TAM) is a Top-Down analysis. As the name implies, in a Top-Down analysis we will start with the largest possible size estimate and reduce it using information and assumptions about our business and market.\n\nAs an example, let us assume we want to start a new business called Tomatology which delivers tomatoes on demand. How big is the market for Tomatology? We will start with how much consumers spend on food today.\n\nThere are many publicly available sources of market data, especially here in the US where the new Data.Gov initiative makes a lot of raw data about the size of commerce available. You can find out everything from national trade data to how much parents spend on their children. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes an annual Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) which tells us that the average household spends $751 on fruits and vegetables every year, for a total of $94.4B spend every year in the US.\n\nNot everyone who buys fruits and vegetables will want them on demand or be reachable with deliveries! In fact, it only makes sense to offer Tomatology in large cities. About 30% of the population (according to the CES) lives in large cities so we’ll assume only 30% of those sales can be served by Tomatology. That reduces our estimate to $28.3B.\n\nAlso, not all of the fruits and vegetables that are purchased are tomatoes! According to the USDA, only 5% are tomatoes (which are legally classified as a vegetable in the US). That reduces our estimate to $1.4B.\n\nOf course, not everyone will order their tomatoes on demand! Supermarkets will always have some market share, so we will assume that 20% of households would order their tomatoes on demand if offered. That brings our estimate to $140M.\n\nFinally, our business model assumes consumers will buy more tomatoes when they are delivered straight to your door! Our expectation is to grow tomato consumption by 10%. This increases our estimate to $154M.\n\nA shorter version of our Top-Down analysis might look like the following:\n\n\nFor a real top-down analysis you would continue this process with more rigorous assumptions, getting to the most refined market size you can. Obviously, if you miss any important assumptions you will over-estimate your TAM using this technique. That is why, next, we’ll discuss Bottom-Up estimation!\n\n(Note: Tomatology is a very bad idea. However, if you start that business based on this idea I expect you to give me credit.)\n\nWorking your way up\n\nWhile Top-Down market sizing is usually easy to do, it can be misleading. Can you really reach that entire market? How much would it cost you even if you could? The good news is that Bottom-Up market sizing gives us a clear picture of those factors.\n\nTo do a bottom-up analysis you start with the basic units of your business (your product, price, customers) and estimate how large you can scale those units.\n\nBack to our example company, Tomatology (tomatoes delivered on-demand!), a Bottom-Up market sizing needs to start with the price of tomatoes which are around $1 for a large tomato in my area. Our local customer survey tells us that consumers buy 3 tomatoes when they go to the market once a week. That means the average consumer would buy $150 of tomatoes per year.\n\nHow many consumers can we reach? Based on the effectiveness of commercials, billboards and other channels our head of marketing thinks we can reach about 35,000 households in our hometown of Oakland, CA. That brings our estimate to $5.3M.\n\nFinally, we will assume that we can expand into the top 30 cities based on our operating plan and available capital. That gives us an audience of 1.1M households or a total of $156M.\n\nA shorter version of our Bottom-Up analysis might look like the following:\n\n\nThis is, like our Top-Down model, simplistic and a real Bottom-Up model would include many more steps to get to a better estimate.\n\nNote that our Bottom-Up model ignored some important factors like how long it would take us to reach consumers, churn rates of customers and whether there is competition. Remember, we are trying to size our Total Addressable Market which is only our market potential. The market reality in your business plan will need to address these other concerns and determine what percentage of your TAM is really achievable.\n\nSo now that we have Top-Down and Bottom-Up market sizing experience, which do we choose when sizing a market? Tune in tomorrow, the answer may surprise you!\n\nOver the past few days we’ve reviewed Top-Down and Bottom-Up approaches to sizing a market. They both have advantages and disadvantages based on the kinds of assumptions you make as part of the approach.\n\nSo, which should I use: Top-Down or Bottom-Up?\n\nBoth. On their own, neither Top-Down or Bottom-Up analysis give you a complete picture. Top-Down hides the difficulties in reaching various segments of customers while Bottom-up assumes there will always be more customers in the segments you know how to reach.\n\nYou have a good estimate of your market size when both your Top-Down and Bottom-Up models agree with each other. It may require updating your assumptions to get to such agreement, but those updates should be positive improvements that make the final estimate more accurate. It’s the equivalent of comparing your homework with a friend’s to see if you got the same answers.\n\nLuckily our Top-Down and Bottom-Up models for Tomatology, our hypothetical leader in on-demand tomato delivery, roughly agree at a market size around $150M. If you aren’t so lucky, reexamine your assumptions and see where the gap might exist. If you cannot make the two estimates agree there might be something fundamentally broken about your market or your business.\n\nOne more thing…\n\nWe can get even more confident in our estimates using comparables. Comparables are companies that are similar to yours, either in business model, product types or market position. A good comparable is a company that is already at scale and serving the same customers that you will serve (both now and in the future).\n\nFor Tomatology, our hypothetical leader in on-demand tomato delivery, comparables might include:\n\nInstacart\nAmazon Fresh\nBoxed\nPostmates\nBy looking at the size of these comparable businesses you can determine if your estimate is realistic. If your market estimate is $1B but no existing comparable does more than $10M in revenue then you are probably overestimating the potential (or you have a clever way to grow the market!). If your estimate is $100M and some of your comparables do $200M in business then you might be a little too small. Use it as a third check of your estimate!\n\nNext, we’ll look at how to size new markets, who don’t have existing customers or any available comparables. It will require us to get even more creative!\n\nThe future is hazy, please try again.\n\nWhile market sizing can seem straightforward after everything we’ve discussed, the more interesting markets to size are the ones that don’t yet exist. These are new markets, created by changing consumer needs, technological innovations or shifts in the availability of resources. New markets lack all of the inputs we used for our previous sizing exercises!\n\nHave no fear, you can still estimate the size of a new market although it will be less accurate. To do so you need to make more aggressive assumptions.\n\nLet us assume Tomatology (our hypothetical on-demand tomato delivery company) runs into hard times as consumers don’t buy tomatoes on demand as much as our estimates would have predicted. So, we come up with a new product called a Tomapple which is a hybrid of a tomato and an apple! But what is the market size for the Tomapple? No one buys them today so we can’t use the Top-Down or Bottom-Up approaches we used so far.\n\nOr can we?\n\nEven those the Tomapple doesn’t exist yet, consumers buy other food every day. New products are either going to be replacements for existing products or create new demand for something that consumers don’t spend on today. It’s important to know which category your product falls into because sizing is different for each:\n\nReplacements: Sizing the market for a replacement works exactly the same as sizing for an existing product. You simply size the market for the product you will be replacing and make an assumption about how much of that market you can replace with your new product.\n\nNew Demand: New demand sizing is harder and requires you to understand how much buying power your prospective customers have today and how much is available to spend on something new. This is why new products often target wealthier customer segments as luxury goods (iPhone, Tesla, etc.) because those customers have more buying power and hence the ability to buy something new.\n\nSizing your market is an important step in understanding the potential of your business and the value you can create. It is also a useful exercise to help you understand the key obstacles you will need to overcome in growing your business. I", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

See Customer Segmentation Model to identify those markets.Identify the Customer Type and Functions they would use the product for and try building a model like this:\n\n\nWhat is Market Sizing?\nEver thought/heard questions like:\n\nHow big is the used mobile phone market in India?\nWhat is the market opportunity if you introduce a new clothing line in India?\nWhat is the market opportunity of launching a cab aggregator in India? How did Jugnoo grow against Uber/Ola in India?\nMarket Sizing is a method of evaluating the potential reach and revenue of your product/service.\n\nMarket Sizing is Divided broadly into 4 Categories:\n\n\n1. Market Potential:\nAssuming 100% market Share, the total potential value of product/service sold over a specified timeframe.\n\n2. TAM (Total Addressable Market):\nThe potential value of Product/Service sold to a particular customer segment.\n\n3. SAM(Serviceable Available Market):\nThe total value of Product/Service that can fulfill the demand of a segment using a one revenue stream/channel.\n\n4. SOM(Serviceable Obtainable Market):\nThe total value of SAM divided by the expected percentage market share that the company can capture.\n\nWhy is it Important?\nQuantify the sales or profit potential of new product markets or customer segments.\nIdentify product lines and customer segments with lucrative growth opportunities.\nHelps validate Business Model hypothesis.\nSpecify competitive threats and develop strategic responses to those threats.\nDevelop exit strategies or pivot points for the future.\nImportant to Investors: They want a scalable product addressing a large enough market to get the most bang for their bucks. Listen to them.\nHow to use Market Sizing:\nFirst, let’s ascertain the Quantifiable Values that we are looking for:\n\nValue: Total value of clients/products in the market.\nUnits: Total Number of clients/products in the market\nMarket Share: % of clients/products acquired/sold by your competitors vs total value/units.\nMarket Sizing Approaches:\nTop Down: This type of sizing is done generally by using Demographical data like Company size, industry, location or Human Population, Age, Income etc. Base your hypothesis on a large number and work your way down from there. You can segment the market the way it best suits the business.\nBottom Up: Identify the Micro segment or the niche market you are targeting and extrapolate the numbers till you reach an appropriate scale. Eg: Calculate how much an average person spends a day in the office cafeteria, and now multiple it by the number of employees and number of working days in a month/year.\n\nFor both approaches, include price at the last step. We recommend using both methods to try to solve the problem. Both approaches might produce different results, but in general, they should be close enough to triangulate on a more accurate answer.\n\nMarket Sizing Techniques:\nProduct Market Analysis:\nWorking Excel model here.\nMarket Sizing using StartupFlux: (Video Demo coming soon)\n– Slice the market using Location (city, state, country, continent)\n– Select an Industry\n– Select a value chain eg: manufacturing\n– Add more data points: like the number of employees or social stats\n– Get the Number of Companies matching the criteria\nSpending Data:\nResearch firms and analysts publish numbers on how much companies/people spend on product/services over time.\nCensus Statistics:\nGovernment and public/private companies publish a lot of data about customer demographics, list of registered companies etc that can be used to estimate the market size.\nMarket Projections:\nConsider the estimated growth rate of the vertical/segment to identify if it is growing or declining. This would give a rough idea of how difficult or easy the market could be to penetrate. Google Search for market analyst, research, and consulting firm estimates to get reliable numbers.\nMarket Sizing is important to confidently answer several key questions that a business needs.

And the question that I typically ask is “why do you want to raise money?” While there isn’t a perfect, consistent or even correct answer, I’m always curious to hear how these entrepreneurs plan on investing the money they want to raise. However, the question I find missing in most pitches is not regarding their stellar product or service or traction or team, but regarding market size.\n\nOften times, market size tends to be one important signal for venture capitalists to invest in a company. But more importantly, the size of the market could also help a founder discern whether their business is one that needs to be VC funded or not. Not being a VC myself, I couldn’t possibly tell you what the right market size is to identify what a VC funded business is or is not (or which firm you are a fit for, more specifically). But this exercise could help you in a multitude of ways. I cannot stress enough how important it is to identify the market (use bottom up analysis) and to be honest with yourself about what the size of the market truly is. Take your time with this exercise, do not rush it. And once you’ve got this information, you will find yourself referring back to this research several times during the course of your endeavor.

{"prompt": "How to determine market size for a product\nRunning a Business\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nWhy do we need to estimate market size\nHow to estimate market size\nThe market is there, what’s next?\nMORE BUSINESS ACADEMY ARTICLES\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP)\nProduct Market Fit\nLooking at Metrics in a Healthy Way\nQuestions to ask when interviewing for a remote position\nOne of the most important things to know before you even think about turning an idea into a product, is the size of the market you’re going to be targeting.\n\nWhy do we need to estimate market size\nThe most obvious reason is to make sure we have a large enough opportunity to turn our idea into a profitable business. We might have a brilliant solution, but if it’s solving a problem that’s shared only by a handful of people, it’s not going to be a commercial success.\n\nMoreover, in the process of analyzing the size of the opportunity, we would also need to think through various aspects of how we’re going to bring our product to market. This can help us make important decisions about the features we’re going to include in the product and the places where we’ll offer it to customers. For example, if we find out that a large part of the market consists of enterprise customers, we’ll be aware that we need to consider hiring a sales force early in the lifecycle of our product.\n\nHow to estimate market size\nThere are various ways in which you can determine the size of a market. The two quickest and most common ways entrepreneurs use are the top-down and the bottom-up approaches.\n\nTop-down approach\nIn the top-down approach, you use a central source of data to gather intelligence on the total size of an industry and a mix of additional data, logic, and guesstimation to determine the size of the specific market that can be addressed by your product.\n\nFor example, if you’re planning on developing a SaaS tool for SEO agencies and consultancies, you should start by looking at the total size of the of the industry — $65 billion in 2016. Sounds great, but if you look more carefully at the report, you’ll notice it includes spending on buying email lists, etc., which is not part of what your tool will be doing (and, hence, cannot be included in your calculation of the addressable market).\n\nHere’s a great example from VigLink, an ecommerce services provider, which shows how they’ve broken down a large industry into a specific segment, which they can attack with their product:\n\n\n\nThat way they’ve went from a huge number (~$670B) to a very specific “tiny” segment of $1.2B where they’re well-positioned to build a profitable business.\n\nBottom up approach\nSometimes finding reliable and detailed data on the size of an industry is not easy, so we have to resort to using a bottom-up approach where we infer the size of the addressable market based on how many customers we estimate it contains and how much they’re willing to spend on a solution similar to what we’re planning to build.\n\nWe’ll use another example to demonstrate how this works. Let’s assume we’re working on a CRM tool for freelancers. We know the total market for CRM in 2016 was a little over $26B and that it is dominated by a few large incumbents like Salesforce, SAP, Microsoft, and others that offer expensive solutions targeting large companies. However, we’re interested in capturing a specific niche, which isn’t necessarily using a CRM tool at the moment (i.e. we’re looking at expanding the market, not just capturing a slice of the existing pie).\n\nIn this case, we can gauge the market opportunity by predicting the number of paying customers we can generate within a specific time frame. We can quickly find out that there are over 57m freelancers in the US alone in 2017. If we can capture just 1% of those within 5 years, we would have close to 600k customers.\n\nComing up with a number of what they’d be willing to pay is just a bit more challenging. One way to do it is to look at the ARPU (or Average revenue per user) for services that target a similar demographic and adjust based on how similar our offering is and how painful we think the problem we’re solving is. (If you can’t find an ARPU number, just take the lowest plan available.)\n\nWe’ll assume a minimal $10/month or $120/year from which we get:\n\n600,000 customers * $120 = $72 million in [ARR](https://baremetrics.com/academy/annual-run-rate-arr) (``*Annual Run Rate*``)\n\nOf course, that a very rough (and probably a very inaccurate) estimate, but it gives us a reliable ballpark number which we can use to judge the opportunity.\n\nThe market is there, what’s next?\nEstimating the size of a potential market is the first step when you’re planning on starting a new business. These techniques can be used to quickly vet a potential product idea and/or convince an angel/VC investor that there’s a viable business model behind it.\n\nIf your estimation proves there’s a large enough opportunity, the next step is to start thinking about the channels that will help you generate customers for your new product.", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "HOW TO ESTIMATE MARKET SIZE FOR A STARTUP\n8 JULY 2019•8 COMMENTS• FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS\nBY GIULIA GIRARDI\nRachleff’s Law of Startup Success (of Andy Rachleff, formerly of Benchmark Capital)\n\nThe #1 company-killer is lack of market. When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins. When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins. When a great team meets a great market, something special happens.\n\nThe market is certainly one of the top three factors in a startup’s success or failure, together with team and product, with different investors and thought leaders siding with each of them. Probably the most vocal of them all, Marc Andreessen, is a strong market advocate, stating emphatically that even a mediocre team with a great market can make it.\n\nEstimating market size is then much more than an exercise to complete a presentation. It is the activity of understanding how the current and future state of the world supports your offering, as well as your competitive positioning and product/market fit.\n\nWhat’s a market and what do people mean with its size?\nTo estimate the market size, the first step is actually to understand and crystallise what a market is.\n\nFrom Geoffrey Moore’s “Crossing the Chasm” a market is:\n\nA set of actual potential customers…\n\nfor a given set of products or services\nwho have a common set of needs or wants, and\nwho reference each other when making a buying decision.\nBasically it is an aggregate of buying decision-makers that have a common need/want and are willing to spend money to fulfill it. In addition, according to Linowes, they have the potential to reference each other when making the decision.\n\n“A market is a set of connected customers, thus far away geographies generally count as separate markets”\n\nAccording to the last clause, completely disconnected markets, like restaurants in Mumbai and New York, do not really count as same markets because the average buyers cannot reference each other. They count then as two different markets.\n\nNow that the definition of market is clearer, what about the definition of market size?\n\nGenerally market size is split in two – the size in terms of number of customers, and the one in terms of monetary value. For the sake of clarity, we’ll be referring to the former as market size and to the latter as market value.\n\nThe first step to estimating the market size is understanding the market\nThe market is then the aggregate of buying decision makers. They have a common need/want and that is what classifies them. When estimating the market size for your company, the need/want in question is the one fulfilled by your product/service. Hence the most overused sentence in startup and company development lingo, understand your customer.\n\nIf you have been building a product and talking to potential or actual customers, you probably have a good enough idea of who they are and what need does your product fulfil. (In case you don’t).\n\nEnrich the analysis by thinking broader\nAs any founder can confirm, it is really hard to take a step back from the narrow focus of the company and the product. That is why I’m a strong believer in little exercises to broaden our thinking.\n\nNow that the product need and target customers are clear, let’s go through 3 steps that allow us to step out and get a more eagle-eye view.\n\nBroadening step 1: Substitute products\nAnswer these questions:\n\nWhat are the products that substitute mine almost exactly at the moment?\nWho are the direct competitors?\nAre they fulfilling exactly the same need?\nPut yourself in the shoes of your customers and try to answer these questions from their perspective.\n\nBroadening step 2: Replacement products\nNow let’s take this a step further:\n\nWhat are the alternatives that the customer uses to fulfil the same need?\nWhat are their disadvantages?\nHow much do they cost?\nHow many people are buying them?\nBroadening warning\nThere are few products and companies that are actually creating a market. They are the exception. The market is usually finding or putting together solutions already. Before Slack, people were using a mix of Facebook Groups, chats, hangouts, emails etc. Communication as a problem has always been there. The right solution is the one that took over the market.\n\nThe second step in estimating market size: Research\nYou should have by now a pretty good idea of what the market is. Now it’s time to estimate the number of customers the market has.\n\nThis step is usually very market specific. But there are some guidelines.\n\nStart broad: when estimating the potential clients for a food restaurant in a city, look up its population on Wikipedia. Narrow it down to the percentage of the city that is within car reach (if there is available parking). Narrow it down to the percentage of the population that is going to be attracted by your specific product, e.g. no kids in a cocktail bar, etc.\nBe realistic: generally if your analysis ends up identifying almost everybody as a potential customer, you probably have to go back to step 1. Not all businesses are going to use Salesforce (because of pricing, positioning, etc.)\nThis exercise is mostly for you: investors and stakeholders are also interested in your market size. However this number does not affect them as much as it affects you. They are diversified, they invested in a number of companies, and they don’t have to face customers and employees when things go sour. Having credible, reliable and realistic market numbers is a competitive advantage that impacts mostly you.\nConsider the future: Markets are always moving- the smartphone app market did not exist 10 years ago. Now companies that only develop apps can break 1Bln valuation (Supercell) and enter the unicorn club.\n“Past and future of a market are as important as its present state“\n\nGiven these premises and guidelines for the approach, you should proceed to identify:\n\n1 | The Potential Market, the upper limit of the market size. The maximum demand level for a product in a certain area and period of time. It implies that:\n\nEvery subject, who is able to use the product, uses it\nEvery user adopt the product at every usage occasion\nEvery time that is adopted, the product is used in the optimal dose\n2| The Total Market Size (or primary demand), that is the total volume of a product or service that would be bought by a defined consumer.\n\nTip: Remember to consider not only the number of clients in the market, but also their frequency of usage of the product during the specific time frame (e.g., one year).\n\n\n\n3| The Secondary Demand, that is the market share held by your company.\n\n\n\nThird step: Research + Competitive Analysis = Price\nNow that you have the number of potential customers in your market and you have investigated substitute and replacement products, you should have a well formed and strong idea about:\n\nThe market size\nThe value per customer\nNow it’s just about multiplying:\n\nMarket size (number of potential customers) * value per customer (Price) = Market Volume\n\nTip: The reliability of these numbers only goes as far as the reliability of their assumptions. The final market volume can be a very well rounded estimate. It is very useful to check it against some numbers. Generally, there is research available on the aggregate expenses of a certain sector (e.g. CRM software, SaaS software, Food and Dining etc). If your product does not create additional demand (again those are the exceptions) the market volume should reflect and not be 10X what customers are spending already in a category of product.\n\nStep 4: Consider Timing\nStartups and companies take years to form. Technology is increasing the speed at which markets change. On top of that, all information is worth much more in context. For these reasons, you should consider the history and the future of the market. Understanding market size in context improves the reliability and confidence of your estimate as it gives you more insights into how to better tackle its future developments.\n\nConclusion:\nIf the #1 company-killer is lack of market, then understanding your customer segment, their behaviour, their aggregate number and purchasing power, gives you an unbeatable edge in increasing your chances of success, funding, and growth.\n\nThe next step to estimate your business potential, is to make financial projections. Check out our partnership with ProjectionHub for a way to make that easier!\n\nWhat is your take on market size estimation? Are there other tricks, techniques, or tools to do this in a better way?

{"prompt": "What is market size?\nentrepreneurship, strategy\n\nI’m a judge for Mass Challenge, as well as the Harvard Business School competition, and I’ve noticed that many entrepreneurs don’t know what market size means. Let me call out two of the most common mistakes, which can be the difference between recognizing a real opportunity and fooling yourself into believing something is an opportunity when it isn’t.\n\nWhen a potential investor (including you, investing your time and career!) asks the size of your market, they’re asking how much money is out there (or how many customers) that could conceivable be spent on your company.\n\nMarket Size Isn’t Demographics\n“The market for our new deodorant is anyone over the age of 12.” Actually, it isn’t. That’s way too general. Your market is defined at least in part by who you can reach. Your accessible market is what matters. You can’t reach everyone over the age of 12. “The market for our new deodorant is teenage girls between 14 and 18.” That is a much more realistic assessment and probably much more reachable through advertising in an identifiable set of magazines, TV ad spots, etc.\n\nMarket Size Isn’t Your Customer’s Revenues\nThe other big mistake entrepreneurs make is giving the market size as the total market revenues of all possible customers. “We sell hand sanitizers to media companies. Combined media revenues were $100 billion last year.” That’s a slippery evasion, because no media company will spend all their income on hand sanitizers. The market is not total revenues of all possible customers, but total amount all possible customers are likely to spend on your product. “Media companies spent $100 million on hand sanitizer last year, so that’s our market size.”\n\nMarket Size is the Potential Revenues You Can Reach\n“The market for our internet-enabled back scratchers is middle-age men who feel the need for meaning in their lives. There are 50 million of them in my country, and at $19.95 (+ shipping and handling) that’s a billion dollar market.” Yes, except there’s no way to reach all 50 million of those customers. If there were a mailing list of all 50 million, you could do it. And you can certainly try your best to cover every possible advertising and media outlet that reaches middle-age men. But at the end of the day, only people you can reach with your message are potential customers.\n\nAn acquaintance of mine is developing a product for online gamers who make a living by livestreaming their games. That’s an addressable market, because there are forums, awards, conventions, podcasts, and an entire media ecosystem that pretty much every live streamer follows.\n\nTo put it all together:\n\nWhen you’re evaluating the potential of an opportunity, be careful to ask how much money could reasonably come your way from the customers you’re explicitly able to reach. That is a much better number to use for market size.", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "Market sizing\n2/10/20150 Comments\n \nPicture\nOne of the most important determinants of a new venture’s success is calculating the total potential market size and value. Knowing this figure helps determine how much money your business can make and also competitive market share. Whether you’re creating a business around a new product or coming out with a different version of something that already exists, it’s important to determine the overall size of your market. This information will be highly valuable as you reach out to potential investors and banks for funding. Additionally, you should always be aware of how many customers you could potentially serve.\n\nWhat does market size mean? Basically, it’s the number of customers potentially interested in your product or service, and the total possible amount of money that could be spent on that product or service. It sounds easy enough, but how do you measure something intangible?\n\nThis guide breaks down the five steps to estimating the market size providing specifics on where to find the information.\n\nThe following are key steps in calculating the market size measured in number of customers, market volume, and market value:\n\nDefine the total geographical population\nDefine the market segment and estimate the percentage of target customers in that area\nEstimate average number of items purchased at a time\nEstimate average purchase frequency\nCalculate selling price\nThe following formula is used to estimate the total size of your product or service’s market. Keep in mind that this is not necessarily how much your company can capture, but the total amount possible in the market. The market size is calculated by determining a value for all of the variables and then multiplying them together.\n\nFormula for Calculating Total Market Size (in dollars):\n\nMS = N * TC * Q * F * P\n\nMS = Market Size\n\nN = Total Geographical Population\n\nTC = Percentage of Target Customers in Geographical Area\n\nQ = Quantity purchased at a time\n\nF = Purchase Frequency in a year\n\nP = Price of Product\n\nThe following sections break down how to determine each of the necessary variables. Keep in mind that all of the values will be estimates, and this is OK! Market sizing isn’t precise, and we will discuss tips on how to make it more reliable through sensitivity analysis at the end.\n\nGeographic Population (N)\nThe total geographical population is the number of people living in the area your businesses will target. This can be national, regional, statewide, citywide, or a specific neighborhood. This geographical location should reflect the service or product you are selling. If you’re opening a coffee shop, use the population of your neighborhood. If you’re launching a mobile grocery list app, use national population data.\n\nMany governments and municipalities publish this data and you can access it online. The US Census bureau has detailed breakdowns country wide, by state and by zip code. For city level data, go to your local municipality website and check if they publish population information. Examples can be found at (https://data.cityofchicago.org/ ,  https://data.ny.gov/ , https://data.sfgov.org/ ). If not online, you can contact them directly and they will provide you with the information.\n\nFind the population size for your target market and insert it as N in the equation\n\nPercent of Target Customers (TC)\nNow that we identified the total geographical population, we have to estimate how many people within that area will potentially use your product/service. Determine who your target customer is and create a profile of your typical/expected target customer. It is critical to recognize that the target customer equals the person or company for whom your technology solves a specific problem. Defining the target customer is an essential task for all start-ups.\n\nThe target customer is generally described using demographic variables: gender, age, education and income. The customer is also described using psychographic variables: lifestyle, interests and belief system variables. The more specific your target market, the harder it will be to find specific data to match all the criteria.\n\nYou can find single variable demographics such as age, marital status, household income, gender, race/ethnicity, and education by using US Census data:\n\nGo to quickfacts.census.gov to access national and statewide data in the US\nSelect the target state from the dropdown menu. If nationwide, select USA.\nSelect Browse data sets for [state] at the top\nSelect Demographic Profile\nFrom this list, find the numbers that fit your target demographic. This list contains a breakdown of age groups as well as other demographic information\nTake the percentage figure for your target demographic and this will be the value for TC (% of Target Customers in Geographical Area)\n\n\n\nQuantity Purchased at a Time (Q)\nConsumers will purchase different quantities of a product/service depending on how they interact with it in their daily lives. Products can be purchased one at a time or in multiples. Depending on the nature of your product, how many units do you expect customers to purchase at a single time? Light bulbs are typically purchased in multiples, say 2 or 4 at a time, while a personal computer may be purchased 1 at a time.\n\nIf you know how many units are purchased at a time for your product/service by a single customer, use this number as the value for Q (Quantity purchased at a time). If you do not know this for your product/service you can estimate by searching industry reports in your category, observing consumers, or conducting a survey asking “When purchasing this product/service, how many will you purchase at a time?”\n\nPurchase Frequency (F)\nPurchase Frequency is a determination of how often your target customers would purchase your product/service. This figure will have a significant impact on the estimated market potential. For instance, is your product purchased frequently, occasionally or infrequently? Obviously, the more frequently the product is purchased, the larger the market potential. Some products like cars may be purchased once every 5 years, while a cup of coffee may be purchased 5 days a week.\n\nIf you know how often your product is purchased in a year by a single customer, use this number as the value for F (Purchase Frequency in a year). If you do not know this for your product/service you can estimate by searching industry reports in your category, observing consumers, or conducting a survey asking, “How often would you expect to purchase this product/service?”\n\nPurchase Price (P)\nPurchased price can be estimated for existing products by identifying similar products in the market place, and comparing the value your product will provide. The price used for this estimate is the average price your target customers are willing to pay for this product.\n\nIf you know how much you will charge for your product, use this number as the value for P (Purchase Price). If you do not know this for your product/service you can estimate by searching industry reports in your category, observing consumers, or conducting a survey asking, “How often would you expect to purchase this product/service?”\n\nFinal Market Size\nNow that we have solved for all the variables, the market size is simply calculated by inserting each of them into the formula. The resulting number for this formula will tell you the total dollar sales possible for your entire market.\n\nMS = N * TC * Q * F * P\n\nAs you can see, a little bit of research can make a big impact on sizing your market. Being able to successfully size your market will help you understand how much money you have to make and how many customers you can reach. Want more?

This is the second in a series of two posts on this process. If you missed it, read the first post here.\n\nMARKET DEMAND\n\nDemand is important. Really, really important. Without a large group of people who want your product, you’re doomed. You can do everything else perfectly and still fail. So it’s crucial to ensure there is a legitimate market for your product before investing time in building your business. The best ways to estimate demand is to actually try selling a minimally viable product, but this can be time consuming. For our purposes we are going to look at a few online tools to quickly analyze demand before investing significant resources and time in other methods.\n\nGoogle Keyword Tool (www.google.com/adwords)\n\nThe Google Keyword Tool shows you how many people are searching for a particular term each month. The search volume for a term can be a proxy for consumer demand and interest.\n\nTo Use: Sign-up for a free Google Adwords account and select Keyword Planner from the Tools menu at the top. Enter your product or category in the search window, and any demographic targeting information. The resulting chart will show you how many people searched for that term every month, and can be used as an indicator for consumer demand.\nPicture\nGoogle Trends (www.google.com/trends)\n\nGoogle Trends identifies the number of searches for a term over time and can be used as a proxy for forecasting increasing or decreasing consumer demand. An increasing number of searches can be interpreted as an in-demand product, while a flattening or declining trend can be interpreted as a product loosing consumer interest.\n\nTo Use: Go to www.google.com/trends and search for your product or category. The resulting graph shows the percentage of searches compared to the peak date. The highest number has a score of 100, and every other date is rated 0-99 in relation to this point.\nPicture\nTopsy (www.topsy.com)\n\nTopsy is a twitter analytics tool that searches all mentions of keywords to determine how many people are actively talking about a product or topic. Twitter is an effective source for looking at market potential and product interest. Use Topsy to search for the volume of tweets per day mentioning your product / service category\n\nTo Use: Enter your search term on the Topsy website and hit enter. Then, click on the graph labeled “Tweets Over Past 30 Days”. From this graph, you can determine how many people are tweeting about your product / service and see what they are saying.\nPicture\nMARKET SUPPLY\n\nIt’s important to understand your competitors in the marketplace before deciding to establish a business. Unless your idea is truly novel, there are likely to be existing businesses that are tackling the same problem. While you don’t have to be first to market your business should address an unmet need either by targeting a different customer, a different location, or a different method. The following tools will help you understand the nature of competition in your area, how many companies exist, and where they are located.\n\nSBA’s SizeUp Tool (www.sba.gov/tools/sizeup)\n\nThe Small Business Administration’s SizeUp tool lets you crunch millions of data points to get customizable reports and statistics about your potential competition. Enter your industry, city, state and other details. The tool then runs various reports and provides maps and data related to your competition, suppliers and customers. This tool is applicable to both consumer and B2B industries.\n\nTo Use: At the tool, enter in the industry category and city you plan to target, then select competition. The resulting window will show you a list of businesses in the geographical area you selected. Try using various data filters to better understand your competition and customers.\nPicture\nGoogle Competition Search (www.google.com)\n\nThe majority of people use search engines like Google to find businesses and services, so it’s a great place to start when looking for competitors. Google is able to identify physical locations of retail businesses or online websites for service and web based businesses.\n\nTo Use: Search your product / service category in Google and note the search results that come up on the first 3 pages. When customers are searching for you, the other companies listed are likely your competition. Identify any clear market leaders and the services they provide.\nPicture", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "Market Sizing – How to Calculate Using Two Methods\nHow to Estimate the Size of a Market\nLet’s talk about how to estimate the size of a market, also known as market sizing!  Why would you want to do such a thing?  Well, maybe you are pitching your awesome business idea to a venture capitalist.  You’re not?  OK, maybe you work for a big company and you want to convince the management team to pursue your fantastic product idea.  Still no?  Ok, well maybe you are a student and you need to pass a test, or maybe you are simply into learning new skills.  Whatever the case, let’s dive in and learn how to estimate the size of any market.\n\nSummary (aka tl;dr)\nMarket sizing is the process of trying to figure out how big a particular market is (in terms of $). There are two primary methodologies to do this: bottom-up and top-down. Bottom-up is simply the # of units X the price of one unit. Top-down looks at the size of a larger market that includes your market, and then tries to carve out the relevant piece. That’s the gist of it, but read on!\n\nDefining the Market\nThe first, and perhaps most important, step in this process is to define our market.  Don’t skip ahead!  It is really important to get this step right.  \n\nSo, before we get into bottom-up vs. top-down, TAM, SAM, SOM, and all that stuff, let’s start with three basic market definition questions:\n\nWho’s the buyer?\nWho’s the user? (yes, it can be different from the buyer)\nWhat is the scope of my market (geographically and/or demographically)?\nMarket Sizing Example:\nThe Market for Coffins in the United States The best way to illustrate all of this is through an example.  Our example is going to be a little weird, but interesting. Here’s the situation: you are a stellar woodworker of cabinets and you are thinking of expanding into the coffin business. Before you get into it, you want to know the market size for coffins in the United States. First, you define your market: Who is the User?: Deceased humans (and vampires)\nWho is the Buyer?: Families of loved ones who recently died\nWhat is the Scope of my Market?: All demographics across the entire United States\n\nSee how the buyers and users can be very different? This happens more often than you’d think. In market sizing, we will focus mostly on the buyers. By the way, let’s ignore vampires from here on, since that’s such a niche market.\nBottom Up Market Sizing\n\nBottom Up Market Sizing is like building up a picture of the market with individual “blocks” of information (e.g. pricing, # of units)\nYou’ll hear about bottom up and top down market sizing methodologies in this article, and anywhere you read about market sizing. Let’s tackle bottoms-up first, since it’s my favorite and generally the more thoughtful of the two options. It’s called bottom-up because you are starting with the smallest bits (# of customer, # of units, average price) and building up those blocks from the bottom to form a picture of the market size.\n\nBottom-up market sizing is actually a very simple formula:\n\n(A) # of Units X (B) Price = Market Size\n\nLet’s apply this bottom-up sizing formula to our coffin example.\n\nBottom Up Sizing Methodology\n\n# of Units?: 1,097,000\nThere are 2.8m deaths per year in the US[1] and 39% of those are burials[2]). Let’s assume loved ones are buying a single coffin for these individuals, so 1,097,000 deaths = 1,097,000 total coffins sold in a year.\n\nWhat’s the Average Price?: $2,500\nThe average casket/coffin is “slightly more than $2,000” [3].\n\n1,097,000 coffins X $2,500 = $2.7B USD Annually\n\nSo, our bottom-up method estimates a total US market size of $2.7B for coffins. That was easy.\nBefore we move on, let’s get into some minor weeds. Item A of our formula–# of Units–was simple in this case. 1 death = 1 unit/year. Great, but what about markets where the buyer doesn’t make only one purchase per year? Bubble gum might be a good example of that. In these cases, we might need to think about how many buyers exist X the # of units/buyer/year in order to get to our estimate of the # of Units.\n\nLet’s dig into pricing (Part B of our formula) a little deeper as well. In our example, one average price was used to size the overall market. That’s great, but what if you are selling more than one model of the product at different prices to different segments of the market? In the case of the market for coffins, let’s look at the following (fictional) market segmentation. We’ve split the market into limited income, middle income, and high income markets, each with a different willingness to pay. We could create market sizings for each segment, but in our example we are looking at the market as a whole and therefore used the weighted average price of $2,500/coffin. Market segmentation is worthy of a post of its own later.\n\n\nMarket segmentation (fictional) of the market for coffins in the US.\nTop Down Market Sizing\n\nTop Down Market Sizing is like starting with already built picture of the market, but you need to remove some blocks (add filters) because they don’t apply to your market\nOK, now that we have bottom-up sizing figured out, let’s talk about another approach called top down market sizing. With top down market sizing, you obtain an overall size of a market that includes your market (but probably more), then you apply some filters to break it down to more closely estimate the your specific market.\n\nWith top-down market sizing, Google is your friend. You might find through secondary research that an analyst somewhere has already published a market size estimate of your market (like this, or this), or a very similar market.  In this case, you are conveniently handed the current total addressable market (also called total available market), or TAM.  From here, you can make out some assumptions and carve out the serviceable available market (SAM) and serviceable obtainable market (SOM).  More on that later. \n\nWhile it is always nice to find a market size estimate like this from a 3rd party, you’ll find that your audience often wants more in-depth analysis from you! \n\nMore likely, you will find that there is a solid data available, but it represents a market that is much larger than your target, and you’ll need to apply some assumptions to widdle it down. Let’s go back to our morbid coffin example to see how this works.\n\nTop Down Sizing Methodology\n\nGreat news! After a stellar Googling session, you find three sources saying that the “death care” industry in the US is a $14b-$20b/year market[4-6]. You take the average of $17b to be best estimate of the truth. You aren’t in the “death care” industry, though. Well, you are, but caskets only represent a small portion of that larger industry, right?\n\nThrough some additional research you estimate that approximately half (50%) of all funeral costs are burial costs, and that coffins make up 33% of the cost of a burial[7]. You are pumped to have all the pieces in place to estimate your market now.\n\nSo, 50% of $17b is $8.5b, which is your estimate of the cost of burials.\nNow you apply your knowledge that 33% of burial cost are due to coffins.\n\n$8.5b in US burials cost X 33% = $2.8b Top Down Market Size Estimate\nTriangulation (Two Methods are Better than One)\nIn most cases, it is a worthwhile exercise to use both top down and bottom up methods to estimate your market. Once you have determined a market estimate with each, I like to present them together individually, and as an overall average.\n\nThe other benefit of using both methods is that each acts as a bit of a check and balance for one another. If you find your results are vastly different from one another, it’s a clue to think through the assumptions of each one more carefully.\n\n\nIt is often helpful to use multiple methodologies to determine your overall market size estimate\n\n\nIn our coffin market example, each methodology was remarkable close to one another. Averaged together, we arrive at an estimate of $2.75B\n\nTAM, SAM, SOM\nTAM, SAM, and SOM are hallmarks of market sizing, and they certainly help us to understand what we are estimating and communicating. Let’s define these terms, then we’ll get back to our example and show you how they work.\n\nPAM = Potential Addressable Market\nI know, I know. PAM isn’t even in the header of this section and you’ve probably never heard of it before. It’s rarely mentioned, but I’ve seen it used from time to time and I really like it as a concept. The key word is potential because it includes the universe of buyers not currently included in your target market, but it’s conceivable that they could be in the future. In our example of the coffin market, we are currently focused on the US market; however, if we have aspirations of global expansion, we ought to consider the entire world. Plus, we are currently only considering those who are buried and excluding all who are cremated. If we believe we can somehow influence trends and shift the entire world towards burials, the potential of all funerals may be considered in PAM. In summary, PAM is the most optimistic and forward thinking view possible. VCs will often see PAM being presented to them under the cloak of TAM.\n\nTAM = Total Addressable Market (aka Total Available Market)\nMost of the time, when people ask “what’s the size of the market?” they are asking for TAM. Most of the time, when a founder presents the market opportunity, they are presenting TAM. In both of our top-down and bottom-up examples earlier in this article, we were estimating TAM. Total Addressable Market is the total market size in your target market–remember early on how we defined our target users, buyers, and market scope? Well that’s our target market. At this point, we are not limiting ourselves to who we can reach or how many we can obtain.\n\nSAM = Serviceable Addressable Market\nWhile it would be awesome to reach the entire TAM, most of the time we cannot, so SAM represents the market we can actually reach with our sales team, resellers, distribution channel partners, etc. In the case of the coffin example, perhaps we only have distribution deals that cover 25% of the US market, even though we aim to reach 100% of the US market. Well, 25% of the TAM is our SAM in this case.\n\nSOM = Share of Market (aka Serviceable and Obtainable Market)\nThis is the portion of the market we actually expect to capture as customers. Now we are factoring in all sorts of things, including the competitive landscape, ability to scale, and so on. In our example, we determined that we have reach into 25% of the targeted US market, but we don’t expect to win 100% of that market because competition will be fierce. Instead, we hope and expect to capture 10% of the market share, which represents our SOM.\n\nCoffin Market Example: PAM, TAM, SAM, SOM\n\nLet’s get back to our example of the US coffin market and see how PAM, TAM, SAM, and SOM play out there:\nPAM TAM SAM and SOM Market Sizing Methodologies\nSummary of PAM, TAM, SAM, and SOM\nSummary and Conclusions\nWe’ve covered the process of market sizing through an example. We learned that it’s important to start by defining our market in terms of the buyer and scope (geographical, demographic, etc.). We learned how to do a top-down and bottom-up size estimate. Finally, we covered the differences between TAM, SAM, and SOM and even the super optimistic PAM. I hope this article was helpful. If you have something to add, please leave a comment below.

Say you have a great idea for a product but there are only 100 people who would buy it. From there, you can decide if that population size is worth the cost of manufacturing, production, distribution, and more for your product.\nMarket sizing helps you estimate profit and potential for growth. If you know how many people your business has the potential to reach, you can estimate how much revenue you can generate. This is valuable for both business owners as well as investors.\nMarket size defines who you’re marketing to and what their needs are. No business can succeed without marketing. Knowing your market size is the first step in understanding your target market and their needs.\nMarket sizing helps your business make better decisions. Understanding your market landscape, gaps, and opportunities will inform your decision-making. It can also help you set more realistic goals, assign resources, and refine your strategies.\nMarket sizing helps your business minimize risk. Starting or expanding a business is inherently risky. Understanding your market can help you anticipate and prepare for challenges.\nMarket Size vs. Market Value\nMarket size is the total potential demand for a product or service. This number usually calculates the number of potential customers, units sold, or revenue generated. So, market size is an estimate of the overall market reach.\n\nMarket value refers to the financial worth or estimated market capitalization of a company or industry. It’s a measure of perceived value. It can give you an idea of how much a company could sell for in a given market.\n\nIn summary, market size focuses on the potential market opportunity, while market value is the financial value of an individual company or an entire market.\n\nMarket Sizing Terms to Know\nBefore diving into how to figure out your market size, there are a few helpful terms you should get to know.\n\nTAM\nTAM stands for Total Addressable Market. This number is the maximum potential revenue or customer base that a company could achieve if it were to capture 100% of market share.\n\nSAM\nSAM stands for Serviceable Addressable Market. SAM is a part of the TAM that aligns with the company's resources, capabilities, and target customers.\n\nSOM\nSOM stands for Serviceable Obtainable Market. SOM is the part of the SAM that a company can get at its current scale. This figure may consider marketing and sales strategies, competitive positioning, and product demand.\n\nMarket sizing terms, TAM, SAM, SOM\n\nCheck out this post to learn more about TAM, SAM, and SOM and how to calculate them.\n\nTarget Market\nA target market is a specific group of customers, industries, or segments that a company focuses on. It's the customer segment that's most likely to show interest, purchase, and appreciate a company's products or services.\n\nPenetration Rate\nPenetration rate refers to the percentage of a target market that a company has successfully captured. It shows the level of market share reached by a company in a specific market segment or overall market.\n\nMarket sizing terms, Penetration rate\n\nIf you're a new business, you can calculate penetration rate by dividing your total customers by the number of potential customers in the target market. Then, multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nLearn more about market penetration here.\n\nMarket Segmentation\nMarket segmentation is the process of dividing the total market into distinct groups or segments. Usually, the people in these segments have common characteristics, needs, or behaviors.\n\nSegmenting the market can help you better understand your target customers. It can also help you tailor business strategies, like marketing, to meet specific segment needs.\n\nValue Proposition\nA value proposition is the unique benefits that a company offers to its target customers. It differentiates a company's product or service from competitors and creates value for customers.\n\nUnderstanding the value proposition is crucial in market sizing. This is because it can help you find the specific customer segments that will find the most value in your offer.\n\nTry one of these free value proposition templates to draft your value proposition.\n\nHow to Calculate Market Size\nStart with your total addressable market.\nFind a group of customers to focus on within that target market.\nFigure out how many of those customers are likely to buy your product.\nMultiply that customer number by estimated penetration rate.\nWhile calculating market size takes only a few steps, it's a crucial process. The steps below will help you understand the potential demand and revenue opportunities for your business.\n\nMarket sizing example graphic\n\n1. Start with your total addressable market.\nYou can calculate your TAM by multiplying the total customers in a market by the annual value per customer. But before calculating, make sure you take a look at the tips below:\n\nDefine your product or service. While developing a product can be quick, growing a business around a product is more complex. It's important to clearly understand your product or service and how it solves a problem or meets a need in the market.\nFind your market category. Some products fall within more than one industry or market category. This is the first step that will narrow your TAM. So, think carefully about what you expect customers to compare your offer to.\nConduct market research. Gather relevant data and information about your potential users. If you're new to market research, check out this free market research kit, with research and planning templates.\nAnalyze the competition. Conduct competitive analysis to figure out the market share and unique value of your top competitors.\nDefine your total addressable market. With the research and analysis you've pulled together, create a realistic TAM estimate.\n\nFree Market Research Kit\n5 Research and Planning Templates + a Free Guide on How to Use Them in Your Market Research\n\nSWOT Analysis Template\nSurvey Template\nFocus Group Template\nAnd More!\nDownload Now\nLearn more\n2. Find a group of customers to focus on within that target market.\nDig into the tips below to quantify the top customers in your market:\n\nCreate your ideal buyer persona. Use the Make My Persona tool to outline the characteristics, demographics, and behaviors of your ideal customers.\nSegment your target market. Start dividing your target market into distinct segments. You might base segments on factors like age, location, interests, or buying behavior.\nContinue market research. Continue collecting data and insights about each segment. This will help you understand how big each segment is, as well as their needs, preferences, pain points, and purchasing habits. Your ongoing market research might include surveys, interviews, focus groups, or analyzing existing market research.\nSet pricing for your product or service. For some products, pricing is a deciding purchase factor. So, if you haven't already, set pricing or a price range for your products.\nAssess segments of your market and prioritize. Think about each segment's size, growth potential, and competition. It's also a good idea to think about how each segment aligns with your company's capabilities and resources. In short, don't just focus on segments that offer the most attractive opportunities. Make sure they align with your strengths and needs.\nRefine your buyer personas. With your prioritized segments, take another look at your ideal customer profile. This will give you a more useful buyer persona for your marketing and sales strategies.\nConfirm your SAM with market testing. Test your target segments with a product or service pilot group, measuring their responses and feedback.\n3. Figure out how many of those customers are likely to buy your product.\nThis step will narrow your scope more intensely on the customers who need exactly what you have to offer. These are the people who are looking for you or a clear alternative to your competitors. To quantify this group:\n\nCreate a customer journey map. From awareness to purchase, this process can help you map out the ideal customer path. From how you expect customers to discover your products to the blockers that might keep them from clicking buy, this step is useful for market sizing and beyond. Use these customer journey templates if you're new to this process.\nEstimate conversion rates. Use historical data, industry benchmarks, or industry research to estimate conversion rates. This can help you quantify expected numbers of leads, prospects, and customers in each segment.\nFigure out buyer intent. Create a ranking or score for each segment to measure their likelihood of purchasing your product. This can help you prioritize segments with the highest conversion potential.\nCreate a SOM estimate with your data. The research above will add credibility to your market size estimate. It can also help guide your growth strategies.\n\nFree Market Research Kit\n5 Research and Planning Templates + a Free Guide on How to Use Them in Your Market Research\n\nSWOT Analysis Template\nSurvey Template\nFocus Group Template\nAnd More!\nDownload Now\nLearn more\n4. Multiply that customer number by estimated penetration rate.\nTo calculate penetration rate, divide the SOM you calculated above by your TAM, then multiply by 100.\n\nOnce you have a calculation for your market size, you'll want to make sure you can trust that number. Keep your market sizing current with these tips:\n\nConfirm your data is accurate and reliable. As you complete your research, use reliable sources such as industry reports, market studies, or government databases. Also, check to ensure the data you're referencing is up to date.\nKeep up with market growth, seasonality, industry trends, tech advancements, regulatory changes, and economic conditions. These factors can affect both market size and customer demand.\nReview and update your market size estimates regularly. Market conditions change over time. Plan regular reviews of your market size, then update your calculations with new or relevant data.\nMarket Sizing Methods\nThere are two simple methods for market sizing your business. These straightforward processes can help you use data to gauge market size.\n\nTop Down Approach\nThe first is a top-down approach, in which you start by looking at the market as a whole, then refine it to get an accurate market size. That would look like starting from your total addressable market and filtering from there.\n\nhow to calculate market size using a top down approach\n\nMarket Sizing Example\nLet's say you want to launch a wine company. First, you'd want to figure out how many liquor stores are in the United States — this helps you figure out the total market to which you could theoretically sell your product.\n\nAfter your research, you discover there are 50,000 liquor stores in the United States. Of that total list, you only want to sell to the New England area — including Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island.\n\nYou decide your target market includes the 1,000 liquor stores in the New England area. From here, you conduct research and speak with alcohol distributors to find there's a roughly 40% success rate for wine distribution.\n\nUsing this as an example, we'd calculate the market size using the following formula:\n\n1,000 liquor stores x 40% = 400 liquor stores\n\nThen, if you assume each liquor store will result in $20,000, you can figure out potential revenue using the following formula:\n\n400 liquor stores x $20,000 = $8,000,000\n\nThis means you stand to make $8 million if you penetrate 40% of the total market in the New England area.\n\nBottom-Up Approach\nA bottom-up approach is the exact opposite – starting small and working your way outward.\n\nThis looks like first identifying the number of units you can expect to sell then considering how many sales you anticipate from each buyer and finally the average price per unit.\n\n\nFree Market Research Kit\n5 Research and Planning Templates + a Free Guide on How to Use Them in Your Market Research\n\nSWOT Analysis Template\nSurvey Template\nFocus Group Template\nAnd More!\nDownload Now\nLearn more\nMarket Sizing Example\nUsing the same wine example – Say you found recent data showing that the average cost of a wine bottle in New England is $10. A survey shows that the average consumer buys one bottle of wine a week, or 48 bottles a year. This means that the average consumer spends $480 per year on wine.\n\nNext, you discover that the number of consumers (or households) you can expect to reach in the New England area is 16,000.\n\nAs a result, your market size is 480 x 16,000 = $8,000,000.\n\nIt’s important to note that both methods ignore the existence of competitors, customer churn rate, and other factors that impact sales. With this in mind, you'll want to stay conservative when estimating how much of the market size you'll win and use this as a starting point.\n\nHow to Leverage Your Market Size\nYou've your estimated market size — now what?\n\nMarket size helps your business answer the following questions:\n\nHow much potential revenue can we earn from this particular market? In other words, is it even worth our time and energy?\nIs the market big enough to interest us?\nIs the market growing? Will there still be opportunities to earn revenue from this market in 3, 5, 10 years?\nMarket size is a critical number to know when you're looking for funding. Investors are going to need to know how much money they have the potential to make from a given market. Additionally, it's vital to recognize whether the potential revenue you can make outweighs your business' costs.\n\nOnce you have market size, you'll also want to consider how saturated the market already is with your competitors' products.\n\nUltimately, you can't capture the total addressable market (TAM) — some of those people will choose competitors' products over yours. So you'll need to figure out whether you have a shot at earning enough consumers out of the TAM to make this a worthwhile venture.\n\nEditor's Note: This post was originally published in April 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.

{"prompt": "10 tips for acing your market-size slide\nAlexander Niehenke, Scale Venture Partners\n@aniehenke\nFebruary 17, 2018 12:10 PM\n\nImage Credit: Kzenon/Shutterstock\nJoin Gen AI enterprise leaders in Boston on March 27 for an exclusive night of networking, insights, and conversations surrounding data integrity. Request an invite here.\n\nThe most controversial slide in every pitch deck is often the market size slide. It can set the stage for the future of the company, but too often it is overly exaggerated and not efficiently backed up. Why is this slide so important? Investors care about market size because it allows them to estimate what success could look like — they’re betting on the future market potential for a product or service.\n\nFor example, an early stage investor may seek returns in excess of 20x their initial investment. So, if the initial investment is valued at $10 million, the market needs to be large enough to support a business worth $200 million in the future. We know that SaaS businesses trade at a median 5x revenue multiple, so in order to be worth $200 million, the business would have to generate $40 million in revenue. If the market size is only $50 million, that would be hard to achieve, presuming some competition and opportunity for growth. As you can imagine, the higher the valuation at investment or desired return, the greater the market size needs to be to suit that investor.\n\nKnowing this, and reviewing the thousands of pitch decks we see each year, I’ve gathered my top 10 tips to consider when putting together your market size analysis.\n\n1. Don’t rely on third party research\nThe most frequent mistake entrepreneurs make is relying on third-party analysts to do their homework. The number is invariably huge and therefore likely inaccurate and not convincing. More importantly, a number is not helpful to investors if they can’t also see the inputs and calculations. Entrepreneurs go through extensive thought processes to determine their technology stack, pricing and sales models, and dozens of other data points, so why do they rely on inaccurate, canned market sizing data?\n\n2. Top down is good\nThe best place to start a market-sizing exercise is with a top-down analysis. It’s quick and easy but still delivers valuable insights. Simply put, a top-down market sizing calculates the total size of the market and then estimates your share of that market, following this equation:\n\n[Your Market Opportunity] = [Total Market Size] x [Your Market Share]\n\nJust remember that the global enterprise software market is $354 billion, so whatever subset you choose, keep that relative market share in mind.\n\n3. Bottoms up is better\nThe flaw with top-down market sizing is you have to rely on third-party research (see rule number one) or tangential markets for the total market size estimate. So a bottoms-up approach is better and more thorough. At its core, a bottoms-up analysis determines the individual spend-level of a customer or a group of customers, determines how many of those potential customers there are, and multiplies the two for a market sizing. This formula may sound as simple as the top-down approach, but the devil is in the details. The best bottoms-up analyses have multiple groups of customers and varying spend levels for each group of customers. The level of granularity can create large spreadsheets that incorporate various customer demographics, competition, advanced pricing, and existing spend levels.\n\n4. Use the Census\nThe best resource for market data is the U.S. Census, a fantastic and generally undisputable source. While not the easiest to navigate, it has extensive data sets on the number of companies in the U.S. by industry, subdivided by revenue and employee count. Since most SaaS businesses focus on a set of verticals and customers of a certain size, this is an incredibly powerful resource with which to build a bottoms-up analysis. It also helps avoid frequent citation mistakes, such as 28 million business in the United States (of which 22 million have no employees, which makes selling anything to them tough).\n\n5. Greenfield estimates have more variance than replacement markets\nIt is much easier to do market sizing analyses for replacement products. You can look at the existing spend in customers to assess their propensity for spend as well as incumbents’ revenues in aggregate as a quick sizing of the market. Replacement markets therefore will naturally have smaller variances in market size estimates. A customer that is spending $10,000 annually for on-premise accounting software today is unlikely to spend $50,000 annually to switch to the cloud version unless it provides significant additionally functionality.\n\nEstimating greenfield opportunities, on the other hand, has more uncertainty and therefore more variance. Since few or no customers have ever bought a similar product, you have to make an estimate on the propensity to buy. Likewise, there is probably limited data on what a buyer is willing to pay for the new product or service. As data becomes more sparse, it becomes increasingly important to understand what is being spent on tangential and complementary solutions.\n\n6. Monopolies, even market majorities, are rare\nVery few companies have more than 90 percent market share, and those are usually monopolies. Microsoft Windows, which got prosecuted for anti-trust, only has 85 percent market share. Salesforce, whose name is synonymous with CRM, only has about 20 percent market share. You can propose single-digit percentage market share and still be successful.\n\n7. Lily pads are okay\nEvery so often an entrepreneur pitches a market knowing that dominance in that market is not significant but will allow the company to hop via “lily pad” to the next market. Peter Thiel provides immense support for this strategy in his book, Zero to One. He cites Facebook as an example, which leaped from the more modest college market to, basically, the rest of the world. Rather than trying to hide the restricted size of the initial market, an entrepreneur should use the market sizing exercise to raise awareness of this constraint and communicate about additional markets.\n\n8. Know your comparables\nThe quickest way to lose credibility is to exaggerate a market. Is your new startup reinventing the software stack for dog shelters, which you estimate to be a $50 billion opportunity? An investor is inclined to question your credibility, especially since the total CRM market is only $35 billion. While this example is a bit silly, know what tangential markets your software will cause an investor to think about and the scope of those opportunities relative to your estimates.\n\n9. Match your pitch with your market size\nMore frequently than one would think, an entrepreneur creates a bottoms-up market size. This analysis may suggest that the majority of the market opportunity exists in serving large enterprises. However, the rest of the pitch discusses the go-to-market and opportunity in serving small and medium sized businesses. This disconnect is perplexing to an investor and is usually cause for pausing the pursuit of an opportunity.\n\n10. Share your backup\nThis may be nerve wracking, but it is a great trick for establishing trust and controlling the message. Investors are frequently covering many markets quickly and don’t have the in-depth knowledge of an everyday operator. A thorough bottoms-up spreadsheet is a fantastic tool for sharing and will allow an entrepreneur to guide an investor to their conclusions versus letting an investor wander to their own conclusions.\n\nSmall moments can be pivotal in pitches. Entrepreneurs tend to dismiss the market size slide when it can actually be one of the most crucial pieces of the pitch. By preparing both tops-down and bottoms-up approaches in advance, you will be armed with valuable insights and credibility that can mean the difference between getting funded or getting a polite pass.\n\nAlexander Niehenke", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "Do Big Markets Matter for Early Stage Startups?\nYes, but not initially. And pitching your 1% market share plan in a big market is a recipe for failure. (#21)\n\nBEN YOSKOVITZ\nAPR 25, 2023\n\nAlmost every startup pitch includes a slide on market size. The goal of this slide is typically (and unfortunately) to demonstrate how big the market is and how well positioned the startup is to attain a chunk of that market.\n\nDoes the size of the market actually matter?\n\nYes and no.\n\nLet’s first explore why focusing on a big market is a mistake.\n\n1. Defining Markets is Hard\nHow do you even define a market or the market size?\n\nThe global MarTech (marketing technology) industry is worth between $321B-$510B according to various research reports.1\n\nFor starters that’s a pretty substantial range, but it’s also difficult to know what’s included. If you provide software for automating tweets and LinkedIn messages to help people improve their social media efforts, you’re probably categorized as MarTech. So would you say that your startup is in a $321B industry?\n\nYou can try, but that’s pretty silly.\n\nAnother approach is to define a sub-category inside MarTech. For example: Marketing Automation Software.\n\nThat’s a lot more relevant to the solution above (automating tweets and LI messages), so we’ve narrowed our focus.\n\nThe market size is estimated between $5.8B-$6.5B in 2023 with a CAGR of 12.3% (CAGR = Compound annual growth rate.)2\n\nThat’s a much more reasonable market size because you’ve narrowed down into a sub-category (Marketing Automation Software) but what does this really tell us? Honestly, not much.\n\nTAM, SAM, SOM - What the f**k?!?!?\nMost startup pitch decks will try and define the Total Addressable Market (TAM), while others will go a bit deeper and also define the Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) and the Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM).\n\nWhat the hell are people talking about?\n\nTAM = The complete market (often at a high level; sometimes called the total available market), this is the overall revenue opportunity that is available to a product or service if 100% market share was achieved.\n\nSAM = The portion of the TAM that can be served by a company’s products or services.\n\nSOM = The portion of the SAM that can be realistically captured and served. This is typically a shorter term goal based on the products/services and scale you have today.\n\nNote: There are varying definitions for TAM, SAM & SOM, which makes things even harder to understand. And the definitions are typically focused on “top-down sizing” which is confusing and rarely relevant.\n\nOften SOM is restricted by specific criteria, such as: (1) geography; (2) customer segment; and/or (3) the sophistication of the product (i.e. you only have an MVP and can’t capture all the value in the SAM or TAM initially.)\n\nNote: One of the problems with top-down market analysis is that it usually defines too broad of a customer segment. “Small business” is not a market. It’s simply too vague—but it might be hard to figure out the number of small agencies in the U.S. with 10+ clients that focus on social media marketing related to e-commerce (which is a much better early adopter market definition.)\n\nIf you insist on using TAM-SAM-SOM (\uD83E\uDD2E), recognize that SOM is the only thing that matters. And I still don’t think it’s niche or narrow enough.\n\nVenture capitalist, Sara Ledterman nails it (the thread is great too):\n\n\nType your email...\nSubscribe\nMarkets are complicated but easy to oversimplify\nI came across an epic LinkedIn post by Robert Kaminski walking through the realities of market sizes using Calendly as an example.\n\nIn Calendly’s case the TAM might be “everyone who books meetings as part of their work” (so practically everyone.) If you narrow down to the SOM, it might be “sales teams scheduling meetings with prospects,” which you can start to wrap your arms around. But things aren’t that simple, because there are so many other variables to consider including company sizes, industries, sales models, meeting types, etc.\n\n\nFrom Robert Kaminski on LinkedIn\nWhat becomes evident is that TAM-SAM-SOM is a gross oversimplification of how markets work. And while that oversimplification might look clean in a pitch deck, it doesn’t help you run your business.\n\nThe market you’re actually going after impacts everything, including your value proposition, go-to-market strategy, product roadmap, pricing, sales strategy, etc.\n\nIf you get the market wrong, you’re going to end up wandering the desert. This is why I’m a huge fan of niche markets (more on niche markets in a moment.)\n\n2. The 1% of a Market Fallacy\nOne of the common mistakes startups make when they focus on a big market is the “1% market fallacy” which goes something like this:\n\n“The X market is absolutely huge and growing quickly.”\n\n“All we need to do is capture 1% of that market and it’s going to be worth billions. Billions, I tell you.”\n\nIn the immortal words of Kenny Bania, “That’s gold, Jerry! Gold!”\n\n\nSo what’s the problem with saying you’ll capture 1% of a giant market?\n\n1% of a big market is still a huge number, and it’s incredibly difficult to get there. Further, without any real focus other than capturing a small piece of an enormous pie, you’re again wandering the desert picking up scraps.\n\nIf it was that easy—and often founders present this as a very achievable goal within a few short years—literally everyone would be doing it.\n\nA tiny piece of a giant pie is the wrong way to think about things. Instead, you should be aiming for a big piece of a small pie, initially, and then figure out how to take other chunks of other pies after that.\n\n\nAn important illustration of pies\n3. No Unfair Advantage within a Big Market\nThe final challenge with focusing on a big market is that most early stage startups (and even later stage ones) have no legitimate unfair advantage. You quickly become another player in the space clawing to get that mythical 1% market share.\n\nYou should never start a company on a level playing field.\n\nIt makes no sense to jump into a market without any advantage whatsoever, and yet many people do. They see a gigantic market, figure they’re smart and capable, and go for it. Those founders usually get chewed up. While a lot of startups aim to compete on speed versus incumbents it’s rarely enough on its own.\n\nHow I started a company in the recruitment space and failed (in part because I didn’t understand the market)\nI won’t go into all the gory details (you can read more in my postmortem analysis here and here.) But when I started Standout Jobs in 2007 I rationalized it as follows:\n\n“The recruitment market is massive” (true)\n\n“Every company struggles to find great talent” (also true, but not a real insight)\n\n“We’re smart, we can win in this space” (ouch \uD83D\uDE2D)\n\nIt’s not that we weren’t smart, it’s that we didn’t understand the market well enough. We had a superficial understanding of HR and recruiting, which was one of the big reasons we struggled and ultimately failed.\n\nWe had no real unfair advantage in the market. “Being smart” doesn’t count! Neither does “building cool tech.” Had we focused on a narrower market and understood their pain points deeply, perhaps we would have had a chance.\n\nIn a big market there are going to be big incumbents. While you might look at them as dinosaurs you need to remember two things:\n\nThey won (and won big)\n\nThey want to hold onto their winnings as much as possible\n\nThey’re not always successful at holding on, but most of the time they do, even if they’re slower, more risk adverse and out of touch. The big companies do alright. Being dismissive of them will get you killed.\n\nType your email...\nSubscribe\nA Quick Summary of Why Focusing on Big Markets is a Bad Idea\nI definitely appreciate the appeal of big markets. Those \uD83D\uDCB0\uD83D\uDCB0\uD83D\uDCB0 look so exciting!\n\nBut chasing a big market—certainly early on—is a mistake.\n\nIt’s hard to define a big market and really understand your place in it. TAM, SAM, SOM is generic and doesn’t do justice to how markets really operate.\n\nFocusing on a big market likely means you have a superficial understanding of users/customers, their needs and what will get them to try & buy your solution.\n\nYou set what seem like reasonable expectations (i.e. 1% of a big market) but it’s a meaningless number, and still almost impossible to achieve.\n\nYou have no real advantage in a giant market because there are too many competitors with too much money, history and control.\n\nSo what should you do?\n\nFocus on a Niche\n\nI’m a fan of small markets. Not because I’m hoping you build a small company, but because they’re easier to define, understand and serve. I can wrap my head around a small market because the user/customer, problem, go-to-market, value proposition and solution all become much clearer.\n\nSmall markets drive focus: You become an expert in that niche, which provides you with an unfair advantage over the competition. You go so deep into a market that you know it better than anyone else. You become laser-focused and can ignore the swirling noise around you.\n\nSmall markets move faster: Gaining traction in a small market is like a snowball rolling down a hill. You build momentum in a small market, become well-known, increase referrals & reputation and can start scaling meaningfully.\n\nSmall markets may become big markets: Markets aren’t set in stone. Small markets shift regularly and some of them will become big. If you only look at a big market (i.e. the global CRM software market is ~$60B3) it’s somewhat hardened. You won't shift that market; but you can influence and affect small markets, and those markets are prone to more rapid change, which you can use to your advantage.\n\nSmall markets may already be fairly big markets: You can over-segment a market and go after too small a niche, but in some cases a “small market” may already be quite big. Those “small/big markets” are probably underserved.\n\nSmall markets are great starting points. If you can dominate a small market, you have a chance of expanding from that market to another. I think of small markets as a wedge—you need to be in the game to have a chance of winning.\n\n\nGoing after a niche or small market size is more cost effective and (assuming you have the right solution, value proposition, go-to-market strategy and business model) easier to gain real traction.\n\nRick Zullo, Co-Founder and GP at Equal Ventures writes in a post, “Niche is the Next Big Thing”:\n\n“There are already plenty of challenges for founders to face. Don’t make taking on an army of competitors for the sake of justifying ‘TAM’ another one of them, unless you know you’ll have the resources to win that war. With leaner times undoubtedly ahead, we expect an increasing focus on capital efficiency in the years to come and know that niches provide a pathway for founders to achieve growth AND efficiency, not just momentum amidst a flooded market of competitors that requires hundreds of millions in capital to simply exist. With capital getting tight in 2023, we think ‘niche’ could very well be the next BIG thing.”\n\nSarah Tavel, GP at Benchmark has an awesome analogy on markets, “find a fast current, not a large body of water.”\n\n“Often we talk about markets as if we were speaking about a body of water — a description of the size or depth.\n\nI’ve found it is far more useful to think of markets instead like a river with a current. As a founder (the ship’s captain), your job is to find the current, and then build the best ship (product) and team to ride it.\n\nA strong current makes the actual job of being the captain a heck of a lot easier. You could have a plank of wood to start in a strong current, and you’ll still move a lot faster than a slick boat in stagnant waters.”\n\nSmall market aren’t inherently fast currents—so be careful about jumping into a stagnant one. But there’s a better chance that niche markets are faster moving than giant ones. With the current pace of change (especially tied to the torrid river that is Generative AI), I believe that big markets are being fragmented more aggressively than ever before.\n\nShare\n\nHow to Pitch Market Size\nFor early stage startups, I always prefer seeing a bottom-up analysis of market size.\n\nInstead of saying, “We’re in the Marketing Automation Software space, which according to so-and-so is worth $XB” you calculate:\n\nNumber of customers (in a specific segment!) x Revenue per year\nThis looks fairly simple but there’s a lot that goes into it. Raymond Luk does an excellent job of visualizing this:\n\n\nYou should read his entire post: The Market Size Dilemma\nAnd then read Pear VC’s post: Market Sizing Guide\nHere are the things I like to see on a Market Size slide in an early stage startup’s pitch:\n\nA bottom up analysis as described above\n\nOver a period of 3-5 years (i.e. what you believe you’ll capture; not the total market size during that time)\n\nWith a story on how you intend to expand from one niche market to a next (i.e. the growth story)\n\nAll of this is designed to understand the underlying assumptions that have gone into defining market size, and connecting the dots between the problem, solution, value proposition, business model and go-to-market/sales approach. Everything has to make sense and feel connected with some basis in logic:\n\nThe problem has to be well defined and clear, and specific to a particular user/customer/segment\n\nThe solution & value proposition have to reasonably solve the problem\n\nThe business model has to make sense in the context of how the solution will be used and the value that users/customers are going to extract\n\nThe go-to-market has to be aligned with all of the above (i.e. If you’re selling something for $5k and it takes 6 months, you’re \uD83D\uDCA9 out of luck)\n\nEverything leads to a market size that seems plausible and achievable.\n\nWhy Getting Market Size Right is Important\nIt might seem from this post that the market size doesn’t matter. In fact it does. A lot.\n\nGoing after a giant market, or focusing on a mega-TAM of an ill-defined market is a bad idea & a waste of time, but defining a market is critical.\n\nYour definition of a market size (and how you intend to grow over the next 3-5 years) reveals a ton about the assumptions you have for the business.\n\nIn an early stage startup (pre-seed / seed), the projections are always wrong. I’ve never seen projections actually match up with reality (often the projections are too ambitious, which is fine.) But good investors shouldn’t be looking for reality at this stage, they should be looking for solid assumptions and thinking.\n\nYour market size ambitions over the next 3-5 years — i.e. what you hope to accomplish — leads investors to a better understanding of how well you know the business, the market and the opportunity. The conversation that comes from this is critical.\n\nThe Market Size slide is where an investor can stress test the underlying assumptions with you, and ideally provide feedback from their experience:\n\nIs the growth rate reasonable? How will you achieve it?\n\nIs the price validated? Could you charge more? How will you expand ACV (Annual Contract Value) in the future?\n\nWhy are you going after Segment A? Did you look at Segment B or C? Why are they different?\n\nIs Segment A a growing/big market? Can you build a sizeable company just off Segment A alone?\n\nHow significantly will the solution have to change for you to move from Segment A to Segment B? How much of an investment will that be?\n\nDo you know how to reach customers in Segment A? Do you know if that’s easier or harder than Segment B? Do you believe customers in Segment A will share with others? Could this go viral and lower CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)?\n\nWhat’s the sales cycle look like?\n\nHow is competition positioned in Segment A, B or C?\n\nAnd so on…\n\nThe Market Size slide is where everything comes together to tell a plausible (but still uncertain) story.\n\nIf you use it to demonstrate a giant TAM, SAM and SOM you’re missing a huge opportunity. And if you don’t have well-articulated assumptions underlying the market, investors won’t fund you.\n\nSo Market Size Matters, But…\nThe market size you’re going after matters, but not in the way you might think.\n\nIt’s not about top-down TAM, SAM, SOM calculations that make a weak attempt to prove the market is huge!\n\nNiches are a great place to start for early stage startups. I love a niche that you, as the founder, understand deeply, can reach, and have proven interest from. I almost want to say “the smaller, the better” but with a clear caveat that if the market is too small, you won’t get the benefits of dominating it (think back to Sarah Tavel’s fast moving river analogy.)\n\nMarkets change, shift and grow. Trying to overly define them or put them “in a box” is silly. And there’s a good chance as your startup scales that you realize you’re in a different market than you originally thought. That’s totally fine (as long as you figure it out quickly enough!)\n\nDefining a market size in your pitch deck is primarily about helping investors understand your underlying assumptions, which frankly, leads back to why investors should be investing early stage anyway—the people. If you don’t have any good assumptions or any way of testing those assumptions, you may find investors questioning whether you’re the right person for the job. I much prefer seeing all the messiness, because it builds my confidence in the founder (as long as the founder is not presenting insane assumptions that have no basis in reality.)\n\nIf you’ve made it to this point you might think, “Amazing! I’ll just go find a small market and win.” I wish it were that easy. If you’re looking to build a category defining mega-company, you’re going to need to compete and win in big markets. You can’t build a billion dollar startup in a hundred million dollar market. To win big, you’ll have to win in a big market. But you shouldn’t start there. Even if you know ultimately where you want to go in terms of big market domination, trying to play in those big, nebulous markets early on will likely kill you.", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "How to Measure and Target Your Startup's Market\nRESOURCE HOME\nARTICLES\nEVENTS\nSERVICE PROVIDERS\nSUBSCRIBE\n05/09/22 | 4 MIN READ\nHow to understand market opportunity and competition in terms that investors use, such as TAM/SAM/SOM, and go-to-market strategy.\n\n\nMarket Size\nMarket size is an aspect of your startup that you have limited control over. That being said, it is one of the most important factors when investors are looking to invest in your product or service. If the market is not big enough, there is no opportunity to make a high enough return for investors, no matter the product. \n\n\uD83D\uDD2C Learn about: Funding Options for Biotech Startups\n\nMarket\n\nThere are three main ways to convey market size/opportunity to investors: TAM, SAM, SOM. TAM stands for total addressable market, SAM stands for serviceable addressable market, and SOM stands for serviceable obtainable market.\n\nTAM is the most universal way to convey market size, usually meaning the industry level market size. In other words, TAM is the overall revenue opportunity that is available to a product/service if 100% of the market share was achieved. Of course, it is almost impossible to achieve 100% market share, but this number gives a good estimate for investors to see what type of industry they would be investing in. \n\nAfter finding your TAM, you will need to narrow it down into your SAM. SAM is the revenue for the customer segment that is the best fit for your product. You could also think of it as everyone who should buy your product (but not necessarily will).\n\nFinally, you will need to narrow down your SAM into your SOM. Your SOM is your niche market, or everyone that would buy your product. The SOM will be the smallest number, but is the most important to potential investors because it gives them an accurate idea of your specific market.\n\nCalculating TAM/SAM/SOM\nThere are two main ways to calculate market sizes: top down and bottom up. Bottom up is most often used for SOM, as investors want the most accurate number possible, as opposed to simply a percentage of TAM or SAM. One of the main challenges that comes with calculating SOM is finding data for the calculations. The largest and most common mistakes come from overstating industry size.\n\nTAM, SAM, SOM\n\nTop Down Approach\nFor this article, we will use a made-up product, self-cleaning diapers, as a running example. In order to calculate TAM/SAM/SOM for these self cleaning diapers using the top down approach, you might look for:\n\nTAM = Global Diaper Sales\nSAM = US Diaper Sales\nSOM = California Diaper Sales\nBottom Up Approach\nThe bottom up approach uses your specific pricing, and attempts to find market size by multiplying. For example:\n\nTAM = All moms with toddlers * Price/Unit * Units required\nSAM = All working moms with toddlers * Price/Unit * Units required\nSOM = All working moms in California with toddlers * Price/Unit * Units required\nThis generally requires more demographic data, and it also requires you to have your prices and manufacturing already known. For example, if your calculated SOM is 300 diapers, but your factory can only produce 200 diapers, your real SOM will be 200.\n\n\uD83D\uDD2C Look into: A Deeper Dive into Market Segmentation\n\nGo-To-Market and Competition\nInvestors commonly ask for your go to market plan. This requires you to specifically articulate the marketing and sales channels you need to get your product/service to the market. It does not mean the list of things you need to do before getting your product to the market (creating apps, getting IP, etc). \n\nWhen describing go-to-market, you need to imagine that you already have your product/service finalized and you have already identified your SOM. Go-to-market describes how you will get there, or how you will reach that specific segment of the population. For example, you might need to hire salespeople, attend events, or hire a marketing firm in order to get the word out about your product. This information is important to investors as it lets them know that once the product is finished, you have already thought through the steps of getting real sales. \n\nB2B or B2C?\nNow that you know what go-to-market means, you need to determine your company’s plan for success. The first step is to determine whether you will operate B2B (Business to Business) or B2C (Business to Consumer). B2C typically requires more marketing dollars, as it requires you to go out and find your consumers directly. B2C becomes easier as your market segment (SOM) becomes smaller, as it is easier to find potential customers. Because of this, investors typically prefer B2B businesses, as they often have more established sales methods and channels.\n\n\uD83D\uDD2C Related: Implementing Voice of Customer (VOC) in Your Business\n\nCompetition Matrix\nNext you will want to consider the competition you will encounter when you get to market. Your competition does not have to be an existing product similar to yours. Your competition could also be the way that consumers are getting the job done now (without any product/service).\n\nInvestors want to know that you understand your potential competition, and an easy way to articulate this is with a competition matrix. See the graphic below for an example.\n\nThe Competition Matrix\n\nThis is the most common way to present a competition matrix, with benefits on the left and your competition on top. It is important to note that benefits are not the product's features. For example, “5 buttons” is not a benefit. Instead, a benefit could be that the product is simple to understand/use because of the limited buttons. Usually, benefits will be listed in order of importance, with Benefit #1 being the most attractive benefit of the product. \n\nReaching Your Customer\nFinally, you will need to find how you are going to reach your customer base. Your method will depend on whether you are B2B or B2C, but here are some of the most common strategy examples:\n\nHire your own direct sales force\nContract with an external sales team\nUse distributors\nUse strategic partnerships who sell to your customers already\nDirect to consumer (DTC) via online and/or traditional advertising\nReaching Your Customer\n\nAfter determining the marketing/sales strategy that works for your company, you will want to calculate some metrics to present to investors. These can include:\n\nHow many phone contacts per week to make 1 sale?\nHow many emails to get a response on your call to action?\nHow many free users does it take to convert to 1 sale?\nThese metrics inform investors on the nature of your sales, but they can also help inform your management team on how to best improve your business.\n\nTakeaways\nFinding your market size and understanding how to go-to-market is an important part of any business’s pitch deck for investors. Knowing exactly who your customer is, and how you will get to them, makes going to market much easier.", "completion": "Summary of the article goes here..."}

{"prompt": "The Wonderful Guide to Market Sizing\nWhen you’re preparing to launch a new product, enter a new market, or quantifying your goals for an expansion, understanding market sizing is paramount to your success. \n\nPut simply, market size is the total number of customers (and/or potential revenue of these consumers) who are potential buyers of your product. This figure can be measured in terms of the number of consumers, the total revenue value they represent, or the total number of transactions per year.\n\nQuick Reference Glossary\nMarket Size: the net sum of sales of all players in a market or industry and the revenue they represent. \n\nTotal Addressable Market (TAM): The total potential market a company, organization, or entity can target. TAM is typically measured in terms of the dollar value of potential revenue to be earned.\n\nServed Available Market (SAM): The segment of the total addressable market that businesses offering a particular solution can satisfy. These sub-markets are often limited by factors such as demographics, industry regulations, or location.\n\nShare of Market (SOM): Also known as the “serviceable obtainable market”, SOM refers to the segment of the SAM that a business model is capable of actually serving. So, if SAM is the portion of the market your company can potentially reach, SOM refers to the set of customers within your SAM that can realistically be captured.\n\nWonder Market Sizing Graphics.001.jpeg\nHow to Conduct Market Sizing Research\nGetting Started: Defining Your Market\n\nThe first step to creating an effective market sizing is to define the market in which you’ll be engaging. A few questions to think about before we get into the nitty-gritty details are:\n\nWhat kinds of customers are most likely to purchase my product? \n\nAre these consumers in any set geographical area? If so, where?\n\nAre there any demographic factors (age, income, etc) that can limit our market size?\n\nWhat are your competitors doing in the space? Do they hold a large portion of the market already? \n\nOnce you’ve thought through those questions (and a few of your own) the next steps are to identify and calculate the various market size segments you’ll need: TAM, SAM, and SOM. \n\nHow to Calculate Market Size\nCalculating Total Addressable Market (TAM)\n\nWonder Market Sizing Graphics.002.jpeg\nThere are three methods used to calculate TAM: top down, bottom up, and value theory.\n\nTop Down\n\nThe top down approach works by starting with a universal data set (all consumers) and whittling it down to your target market by applying limiting factors (demographic, location, purchase behavior, etc).\n\nThis method is very useful to validate an opportunity or quickly assess the size of a market, but may not provide the level of detail needed for an in-depth analysis. \n\nBottom Up\n\nOften regarded as the most accurate way to define TAM, bottom up involves taking current business data (sales revenue) and extrapolating it to the larger market. \n\nThe bottom-up formula involves multiplying annual contract value by the volume of accounts in large enterprises (EE), mid-markets (MM), and small & medium-sized businesses (SMB). \n\nThe formula is \"TAM = SUM of (ACV x SMB #) + (ACV x MM #) + (ACV x EE #).\" \n\nValue Theory\n\nWhile the other two methods look at existing data, value theory is more abstract. We use this methodology when assessing the value of a new product or product improvement that hasn’t yet existed in the market. \n\nBeing that there isn’t any market data for this product (yet), value theory calculations of market size are equal to the assumed price of your product times the total number of potential customers.\n\nWonder Pro-Tip: If you can use a bottom up approach, we recommend going this route. If not, taking the time to do the research can be your most valuable asset in doing your market sizing.\n\nBased on which method you choose, you’ll need to gather relevant information to make your calculations through either secondary or primary research. \n\nSecondary research, otherwise known as desk research, involves searching through the public domain for information. The internet holds a wealth of free information including SEC filings, Census data, findings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as subscription based services that range from $29 an hour to thousands of dollars per report. The most important thing to remember with desk research is that there is a lot of outdated or incorrect information on the internet. \n\nAt Wonder, we’ve developed a system called the “Knowledge Assembly Line” that enables our analysts to effectively search the public domain for whatever it is our clients would like to know. We use multiple quality assurance measures and strict research reliability guidelines to ensure that the knowledge we’re sharing is helpful, actionable, and directly answers our client’s question. \n\nAs you embark down your own research rabbit hole, it’s very important that you take a moment to outline a sound research methodology of your own. This will help you avoid misinformation and gather correct, trustworthy findings.\n\nPrimary research involves gathering first-hand data and is often used to complement secondary research efforts. \n\nCalculating Served Available Market (SAM)\n\nWonder Market Sizing Graphics.003.jpeg\nTAM and SAM may seem similar but, unless your company holds a monopoly, they’re most likely going to be different. Measuring your serviceable available market allows you to set more realistic goals. \n\nFinding the size of your served available market involves narrowing down the TAM to the most specific set of customers that would benefit from your product. So if, for example, you sell performance athletic footwear, you’d need to exclude parts of the TAM that include revenue from work boots, dress shoes, etc.\n\nOnce you have narrowed down your customer base, you’ll need to find the average annual revenue these kinds of customers spend in your given market and multiply the two figures together. Put simply the calculation is “(# of Customers) * (Annual Revenue)”\n\nWonder Pro-Tip: Useful resources here include government white papers, industry reports, data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), and traditional secondary research methods.\n\nCalculating Share of Market (SOM)\n\nWonder Market Sizing Graphics.004.jpeg\nUnderstanding what percent of the market your company holds gives you a snapshot of how much revenue you can earn and your standing in comparison to other competitors in the market.\n\nTo calculate SOM, you’ll need to look at information from both this year and last year. Using the years 2018 and 2019, the formula will look like this: \n\nStep One: (Revenue 2018 / SAM 2018) \n\nThis gives you your SOM in 2018\n\nStep Two: (SOM 2018) * (SAM 2019)\n\nThis gives you your SOM in 2019\n\nWonder’s Tip: Investigating close competitors and determining their annual revenue can lead to a more accurate market share estimation.\n\nNow that you’ve performed these three market sizing calculations you have the data you need to start building your pitch deck, go-to-market strategy, or product innovations that will take your company to the next level!\n\nWant to see market sizing in action?
