Everything You Need to Know About Market Sizing
October 17, 2022
Written By Alex Iskold
I consistently see founders get MARKET SIZE wrong in the early stage decks.

At the same time, VCs often pass if they feel that the market is TOO SMALL.

Here is everything you ever needed to know about MARKET SIZING.

SO, WHAT IS MARKET SIZE ANYWAY?
Market size is the amount of money your prospective customers spend.

For example, cloud computing market is $1,600 BN by 2030

Or Healthcare & Heath Ins in USA is $1.1 T

WHY DO VCs CARE SO MUCH ABOUT MARKET SIZE?
VCs want to only invest in big markets. The reason is simple:

Venture scale return on a company is > $100M in Revenue

Say you are in a $1B market, to get to $100M in revenue you need to capture 10% of this market. That's hard.

Most markets are NOT winner take all. Think Uber and Lyft -- they compete. Space X and Blue Origin -- compete, etc

Most markets are CROWDED.

In a crowded market, revenue opportunity shrinks - pie is split.

VCs don't want to invest in a small market because it will likely be a small outcome.

VCs rely on power law - big outliers - to make their math work. Small outcomes aren't good for them!

TOP DOWN MARKET SIZE
There are two ways people look at the market size - TOP DOWN and BOTTOM UP.

TOP DOWN is what founders mostly put in their decks and it is typically incorrect for two reasons.

A) Itâ€™s way too big

B) Itâ€™s not even their market.

Lets look at some examples.

Say you are launching a new cloud based database for machine learning. If you put an entire $1,600 B market for cloud tools as your market size, this is INCORRECT - you are WAY OVERESTIMATING it.

You are NOT proving all cloud tools.

Similarly, if you put $189B - size of ML tools, you are still over estimating it.

There are MANY tools for ML and data layer is only 1 piece of the puzzle, one slice of the market!

Even worse than over estimating is claiming the totally wrong market.

For example, if you are selling digital software in the healthcare industry, NEVER put $1.1 T spent on Healthcare in US in your deck. NEVER.

It is completely IRRELEVANT!

If you are selling digital software in the healthcare industry, even $185B for Digital Health market IS NOT YOUR MARKET SIZE.  Your market is Medical Software which is somewhere between $10B and $20B, and thats not all...

Ultimately your startup is going after a sliver of that market.

So you need to really drill down!

For example, if you are selling to dentists it is $1 - $2B market for entire amount they spend on managing their practice.

In general, TOP DOWN MARKET SIZE is NOT VERY USEFUL, but ...

Google YOUR SPECIFIC MARKET

Research revenue / market cap of larger companies in the space

Trim down and be conservative

Estimate you can capture 1-10% MAX!

BOTTOM UP MARKET SIZE
Bottom up is a MUCH BETTER approach, especially for early stage founders who need to build credibility with investors.

It is also A LOT simpler.

Market size = # Of Customers X Revenue Per Customer.

Here some examples.

There are 180,000 dental practices in the US. If you sell them software for $500 MRR or $6K ARR you are going after 180,000 X $6,000 = $1B in opportunity. To get to $100M in ARR you need to sell to 10% or 18,000 dental practices - and keep them!

Let's look at another example - Netflix.

$20 a month or $240 ARR, assuming they sell to each of the 120M households in the US, Netflix can get $28.8B. Sanity check, it is currently at $7B in the US or about 1/4 of the total market.

Another example - something that looks to be a small market.

Say we are selling SaaS tools to universities in the US at $100K ARR -- which is a nice size contract.

There are 5,000 universities so $500M market.

Most, if not all, VCs will consider it too small.

QUICK HACK FOR MARKET SIZING
Lets go back to the formula:

Market size = # Of Customers x Revenue per Customer.

To get to a big number you need either:

A LOT OF CUSTOMERS who PAY A LITTLE or A FEW CUSTOMERS who PAY A LOT.

Hack - use Netflix as a baseline

100M households paying $10 a month.

Order of magnitude for Netflix is $10B - venture size market.

Learn to quickly shift zeros from left to right.

Example:

100,000 restaurants in the US => Each would need to pay you $10K a month to get the same $10B market - Impossible!

VCs love > $10B+ markets.

VCs don't like < $1B markets.

If you know how many customers you COULD HAVE (Google it!) and you know how much they would pay (ASK THEM!!!) then you know exactly where you would fit.

There is NO EXCUSE whatsoever to not get the BOTTOM UP MARKET SIZE right.

Stop using TAM / crazy out of this world numbers that have NOTHING TO DO with your business numbers in your decks.

Use BOTTOM UP MARKET SIZE & get it right!

SHRINKING OR GROWING MARKET?
Another thing to know about the market is if it is EXPANDING.

For example, EV Market => Expanding, Gasoline based vehicles -- shrinking!

VCs love quickly growing markets - forward looking.

VCs dislike shrinking markets - backward looking.

This gets tricky... Digital Health - Growing!

Traditional Health -- Likely Shrinking!

Overall education - Growing!

Traditional education - Likely Shrinking!

VCs are going to get into the weeds!

NOT A VENTURE SCALE MARKET? NO PROBLEM!!
Some founders get upset hearing that their market is too small, but the best founders DO NOT CARE!

Best founders are on a MISSION to solve a problem, not to generate venture scale returns. Those two don't always align!

If you are passionate about a small market you should still go and build a business!

You can still raise capital, structure it smartly, and grow through the best $ out there - CUSTOMER REVENUE!

VCs are NOTORIOUSLY WRONG about market size. Even Uber and Airbnb initially were told their markets are too small ðŸ˜‚.

The best founders can EXPAND MARKETS. They see the future the way others can't.

Don't be deterred!

SUMMARY
VCs are RIGHT to care about MARKET SIZE
Avoid including a HUGE RANDOM TAM # in your deck
Do research and use BOTTOM UP MARKET SIZE
Even if the market is small but you are passionate - GO FOR IT! What VCs think DOES NOT MATTER!
